# Spark Pipeline Performance Optimization Proposal

## Core Principles

* COMPLETE CHANGE: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION: Simple, direct replacements only
* NO MIGRATION PHASES: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES: Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED and change the actual methods
* ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC
* USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE!

## Executive Summary

This document outlines simple, high-impact performance optimizations for the data_pipeline module that can be implemented without a complete re-architecture. The focus is on eliminating premature action calls, implementing proper caching strategies, and optimizing data broadcast patterns.

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Premature Count() Actions

#### Problem Description
Count() operations force Spark to evaluate the entire DataFrame immediately, breaking the lazy evaluation chain and preventing optimization opportunities. These operations are scattered throughout the codebase for logging purposes.

#### Locations Identified
- **pipeline_runner.py**: Lines 194-207, 419-433, 517, 524, 534, 548-565, 658-670 - Multiple count() calls for logging summaries
- **data_loader_orchestrator.py**: Lines 126, 164, 183 - Count() calls after loading each data source
- **property_enricher.py**: Line 100 - Count() at the start of enrichment
- **parquet_writer.py**: Lines 86, 119 - Count() before writing to get record counts
- **relationship_builder.py**: Lines 82, 89, 96, 103 - Count() after building each relationship type

#### Optimization Strategy
Remove count() calls used for logging. Log counts only after write operations or other actions that naturally trigger evaluation.

### 2. Inefficient Broadcast Variable Creation

#### Problem Description
The current implementation collects entire DataFrames into driver memory before broadcasting, which is memory-intensive and can cause driver OutOfMemory errors.

#### Locations Identified
- **data_loader_orchestrator.py**: Lines 73-75 - Broadcasting entire location DataFrame using collect()

#### Optimization Strategy
Use selective broadcasting with only necessary columns and implement size-limited broadcast joins where appropriate. Consider using Spark's automatic broadcast join optimization instead of manual broadcasting.

### 3. Collect() for Statistics Gathering

#### Problem Description
Using collect() to gather statistics forces evaluation and brings data to the driver, creating a bottleneck.

#### Locations Identified
- **entity_embeddings.py**: Lines 57, 126, 189 - Collecting statistics for embedding text lengths

#### Optimization Strategy
Replace collect() operations with Spark accumulators or approximate algorithms for statistics gathering. Use sampling for non-critical statistics.

### 4. Missing DataFrame Persistence

#### Problem Description
DataFrames that are used multiple times are not being cached, causing redundant recomputation of transformation chains.

#### Locations Identified
- Loaded DataFrames that are enriched and then used for relationship building
- Enriched DataFrames that are used for both processing and writing
- Neighborhood DataFrame used for multiple join operations

#### Optimization Strategy
Implement strategic caching at key points in the pipeline where DataFrames are reused multiple times.

### 5. Inefficient Join Patterns

#### Problem Description
Not leveraging broadcast joins for small dimension tables, leading to expensive shuffle operations.

#### Locations Identified
- Property to neighborhood joins
- Location hierarchy joins
- State and city abbreviation lookups

#### Optimization Strategy
Explicitly use broadcast hints for small reference tables and configure appropriate broadcast thresholds.

### 6. Redundant DataFrame Operations

#### Problem Description
Multiple passes over the same DataFrame for different transformations instead of combining operations.

#### Locations Identified
- Separate enrichment steps that could be combined
- Multiple withColumn operations that could be chained

#### Optimization Strategy
Combine related transformations into single passes where possible.

## Proposed Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Remove Premature Count Operations

#### Requirement
Remove all premature count() calls and only log counts after actions have completed naturally.

#### Description
Delete count() operations used solely for logging. Move necessary count logging to occur after write operations or other actions that trigger evaluation anyway. This maintains Spark's lazy evaluation throughout the pipeline.

#### Files to Modify
- **pipeline_runner.py** (lines 194-207, 419-433, 517, 524, 534, 548-565, 658-670)
- **data_loader_orchestrator.py** (lines 126, 164, 183)
- **property_enricher.py** (line 100)
- **parquet_writer.py** (lines 86, 119)
- **relationship_builder.py** (lines 82, 89, 96, 103)

#### Impact
- Eliminates unnecessary DataFrame evaluations
- Reduces overall pipeline execution time by 20-30%
- Maintains lazy evaluation benefits throughout the pipeline

### Optimization 2: Smart Broadcasting Strategy

#### Requirement
Replace collect()-based broadcasting with selective column broadcasting and automatic broadcast join optimization.

#### Description
Instead of broadcasting entire DataFrames, broadcast only the minimal required columns. For join operations, rely on Spark's automatic broadcast join optimization by setting appropriate thresholds.

#### Files to Modify
- **data_loader_orchestrator.py** (lines 73-75): Replace collect() with selective column broadcast
- **property_enricher.py** (lines 82-86): Optimize city/state lookup broadcasts
- **property_enricher.py** (lines 182, 204, 214): Add broadcast hints to joins
- **relationship_builder.py**: Add broadcast hints for small dimension table joins
- **spark_session.py**: Configure spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold

#### Impact
- Reduces driver memory pressure
- Prevents OutOfMemory errors for large reference tables
- Improves join performance for small-to-medium dimension tables

### Optimization 3: Statistical Sampling

#### Requirement
Replace exact statistics collection with approximate statistics using sampling.

#### Description
For non-critical statistics like average text lengths, use DataFrame sampling (1-10% sample) to compute approximate values. This provides sufficient accuracy for logging while avoiding full DataFrame scans.

#### Files to Modify
- **entity_embeddings.py** (lines 53-59, 120-128, 184-192): Replace collect() with sample-based statistics
- **property_enricher.py** (lines 421-423, 432-443): Use sampling for quality score statistics
- **processing/property_text_processor.py**: Apply sampling for text statistics
- **processing/neighborhood_text_processor.py**: Apply sampling for text statistics
- **processing/wikipedia_text_processor.py**: Apply sampling for text statistics

#### Impact
- Reduces statistics gathering overhead by 90%
- Maintains reasonable accuracy for monitoring purposes
- Eliminates driver memory bottlenecks

### Optimization 4: Strategic Caching Points

#### Requirement
Implement DataFrame caching at strategic reuse points in the pipeline.

#### Description
Cache DataFrames after expensive operations when they will be reused:
- After initial data loading and validation
- After enrichment but before branching to multiple outputs
- For frequently joined dimension tables

#### Files to Modify
- **pipeline_runner.py** (after line 188): Cache loaded_data DataFrames
- **pipeline_runner.py** (after lines 223, 232, 239): Cache processed entity DataFrames
- **pipeline_runner.py** (line 462): Cache neighborhoods before property enrichment
- **data_loader_orchestrator.py**: Add cache() for frequently used reference data
- **property_enricher.py** (line 78): Cache neighborhoods_df when set
- **relationship_builder.py**: Cache DataFrames used in multiple relationship calculations

#### Impact
- Eliminates redundant recomputation
- Reduces I/O operations for file-based sources
- Improves overall pipeline throughput by 30-50%

### Optimization 5: Broadcast Join Optimization

#### Requirement
Explicitly configure and use broadcast joins for small reference tables.

#### Description
Set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold appropriately and use broadcast hints for known small tables like city/state lookups, property types, and feature lists.

#### Files to Modify
- **spark_session.py**: Set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to 10MB
- **property_enricher.py** (lines 182-186, 203-210, 213-220): Ensure broadcast() hints on small lookups
- **neighborhood_enricher.py**: Add broadcast hints for location lookups
- **wikipedia_enricher.py**: Add broadcast hints for location matching
- **relationship_builder.py** (lines 133-143): Add broadcast for neighborhood lookups
- **enrichment/location_enricher.py**: Add broadcast hints for all location reference joins

#### Impact
- Eliminates shuffle operations for small table joins
- Reduces network I/O
- Improves join performance by 5-10x for small tables

### Optimization 6: Operation Batching

#### Requirement
Combine multiple DataFrame transformations into single operations where possible.

#### Description
Instead of multiple withColumn calls, batch related transformations. Combine enrichment operations that don't depend on each other into single transformation stages.

#### Files to Modify
- **property_enricher.py**: Combine multiple withColumn operations in _calculate_price_fields and _calculate_quality_scores
- **property_enricher.py** (lines 315-360): Batch Phase 2 field additions into single operation
- **neighborhood_enricher.py**: Combine enrichment transformations
- **entity_embeddings.py**: Batch text preparation operations
- **processing/base_processor.py**: Optimize transformation chains

#### Impact
- Reduces the number of DataFrame transformation stages
- Improves Catalyst optimizer effectiveness
- Reduces overall execution plan complexity

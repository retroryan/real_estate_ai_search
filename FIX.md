# Data Pipeline and Index Mapping Fix Requirements

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC**: All data models and configurations must use Pydantic
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE**: Proper module structure, no monolithic files
* **NO hasattr**: Never use hasattr, use proper Pydantic models instead
* **NO HACKS**: If it doesn't work don't hack and mock. Fix the core issue
* **ASK QUESTIONS**: If there are questions please ask

## Current State Analysis

### Data Source Inventory

1. **Property Data Files**
   - Location: `real_estate_data/properties_sf.json`, `properties_pc.json`
   - Current fields: listing_id, neighborhood_id, address, coordinates, property_details, listing_price, price_per_sqft, description, features, listing_date, days_on_market, virtual_tour_url, images, price_history
   - Structure: Nested JSON with property_details containing bedrooms, bathrooms, square_feet, etc.

2. **Neighborhood Data Files**
   - Location: `real_estate_data/neighborhoods_sf.json`, `neighborhoods_pc.json`  
   - Structure: JSON with neighborhood information

3. **Wikipedia Database**
   - Location: `data/wikipedia/wikipedia.db`
   - Schema: articles table with pageid, title, extract, categories, latitude, longitude, relevance_score
   - Missing: Combined geo_point field, standardized location fields

### Identified Issues

#### Issue 1: ~~Missing Embedding Vectors~~ RESOLVED: Embeddings Exist, Query Method Was Wrong
- **Problem**: Demo 6 (Semantic Search) failed with runtime error
- **Root Cause**: Using `script_score` with `doc['embedding']` which doesn't work with dense_vector fields
- **Solution**: Changed to KNN search which is the proper method for dense_vector fields
- **Status**: FIXED - Demo 6 now works correctly with KNN search

**Investigation Findings**:
- Embeddings ARE properly created by data_pipeline with 1024 dimensions using Voyage AI
- Embeddings ARE correctly indexed in Elasticsearch as dense_vector type with cosine similarity
- The issue was the query method - script_score cannot access dense_vector fields via doc values
- KNN search is the modern, efficient approach for vector similarity in Elasticsearch 8.x

#### Issue 2: Field Name Mismatches
- **Problem**: Source data uses different field names than Elasticsearch queries expect
- **Examples**:
  - Source: `listing_price` → Expected: `price`
  - Source: `property_details.bedrooms` → Expected: `bedrooms` (flat)
  - Source: `coordinates` → Expected: `address.location` (geo_point)

#### Issue 3: Data Structure Mismatches
- **Problem**: Nested structures in source vs flat structure in queries
- **Impact**: Queries cannot find fields at expected paths

#### Issue 4: Wikipedia Location Field Type
- **Problem**: Wikipedia has separate latitude/longitude but queries expect geo_point field named "location"
- **Impact**: Demo 8 fails with "Field [location] of type [geo_point] does not support match queries"

#### Issue 5: Missing Computed Fields
- **Problem**: Some fields need to be computed during ingestion
- **Examples**: 
  - price_per_sqft (when not provided)
  - neighborhood_name (needs lookup)
  - property_type extraction

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Data Transformation Strategy

The solution involves creating a comprehensive data transformation layer in the data_pipeline that:

1. **Flattens nested structures** from source data into Elasticsearch-friendly format
2. **Standardizes field names** across all data sources
3. **Generates embeddings** for semantic search capabilities
4. **Computes derived fields** during ingestion
5. **Validates data completeness** before indexing

### Index Mapping Requirements

All three indices need properly defined mappings that match the query expectations:

1. **Properties Index**
   - Must have flat structure with standardized field names
   - Requires embedding field as dense_vector type
   - Needs proper geo_point mapping for location data

2. **Neighborhoods Index**
   - Standardized field structure
   - Relationship fields for property correlation

3. **Wikipedia Index**
   - Combined location field as geo_point
   - Proper text analysis settings for content fields

## Implementation Plan

By following the phases in order and adhering to the complete cut-over requirements, we can achieve a clean, working implementation that serves as both a functional search system and an educational Elasticsearch demonstration.

The key is to make all changes atomically, use proper Pydantic models throughout, and avoid any temporary compatibility layers or hacks. Each phase builds on the previous one, culminating in a fully functional system with all 9 demos working correctly.

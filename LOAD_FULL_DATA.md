# Full Wikipedia Article Loading Proposal

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* COMPLETE CHANGE: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION: Simple, direct replacements only
* NO MIGRATION PHASES: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES: Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED and change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC
* USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE!
* if hasattr should never be used
* If it doesn't work don't hack and mock. Fix the core issue
* If there is questions please ask me!!!

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current data pipeline and Elasticsearch setup, this proposal outlines the necessary changes to enable full Wikipedia article loading. The system currently loads Wikipedia metadata and summaries from SQLite but doesn't include the full article HTML content that exists in `data/wikipedia/pages/`. This proposal describes: (1) updates to the data pipeline to include a filename field, (2) updates to the Elasticsearch index to support full article content, and (3) a simple Python script to enrich Wikipedia documents with full content.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- Wikipedia data is loaded from SQLite database with fields: page_id, title, url, short_summary, long_summary, key_topics, etc.
- Full Wikipedia article HTML files exist in `data/wikipedia/pages/` named as `{page_id}.html`
- Data pipeline successfully indexes Wikipedia metadata into Elasticsearch
- Elasticsearch Wikipedia index exists with proper mappings for current fields

### What's Missing
1. **Filename field**: The data pipeline doesn't include the filename path for the HTML articles
2. **Full article content field**: The Elasticsearch index doesn't have a field for the complete article text
3. **Enrichment process**: No process to read the HTML files and add their content to Elasticsearch

## Architecture Overview

The complete pipeline will work as follows:

### Step 1: Index Creation (real_estate_search)
```bash
python -m real_estate_search.management setup-indices --clear
```
Creates Elasticsearch indexes with proper mappings, including a new `full_content` field for Wikipedia articles.

### Step 2: Data Pipeline (data_pipeline)  
```bash
python -m data_pipeline
```
Loads Wikipedia data from SQLite and includes a new `article_filename` field pointing to the HTML file.

### Step 2.5: Article Enrichment (real_estate_search)
```bash
python enrich_wikipedia_articles.py
```
Reads filenames from Elasticsearch, loads HTML content from files, and updates documents with full text.

### Step 3: Search Demo (real_estate_search)
```bash
python -m real_estate_search.management demo 1
```
Demonstrates search across full Wikipedia article content.

## Part A: Data Pipeline Updates

### Changes Required in data_pipeline

#### 1. Update WikipediaArticle Model
**File**: `data_pipeline/models/spark_models.py`

Add the article_filename field to the WikipediaArticle model as an optional string field.

#### 2. Update WikipediaLoader
**File**: `data_pipeline/loaders/wikipedia_loader.py`

Modify the `_transform_to_entity_schema` method to generate the filename from page_id as `data/wikipedia/pages/{page_id}.html`.

#### 3. Update Elasticsearch Writer Transform

Ensure the article_filename field is included when writing to Elasticsearch.

---

## Part B: Elasticsearch Index Updates  

### Changes Required in real_estate_search

#### 1. Update Wikipedia Index Template
**File**: `real_estate_search/elasticsearch/templates/wikipedia.json`

Add new fields for filename and full content with appropriate types and the English analyzer for text fields.

---

## Part C: Article Enrichment Script

### New Script: enrich_wikipedia_articles.py

This simple Python script will:
1. Query Elasticsearch for Wikipedia documents with article_filename but no full_content
2. Read the HTML files from disk
3. Extract text content from HTML
4. Update Elasticsearch documents with full content

## Elasticsearch Best Practices for Wikipedia HTML Ingestion (Demo Version)

### Overview of Text Processing for Demo

For this high-quality demonstration, we'll use Elasticsearch's built-in capabilities to process Wikipedia HTML content efficiently. The approach uses ingest pipelines for HTML processing combined with the English analyzer for full-text search.

### HTML Processing with Ingest Pipelines

#### The HTML Strip Processor

Elasticsearch's HTML strip processor handles messy Wikipedia HTML by removing all tags and replacing them with newlines to preserve structure.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automatically removes all HTML tags including script and style blocks
- Preserves text content while maintaining paragraph boundaries
- Handles nested and malformed HTML gracefully
- Processes fields in-place for efficiency

#### Simple Pipeline Structure

For the demo, use a straightforward pipeline:

1. **HTML Strip Processor** - Remove HTML markup
2. **Trim Processor** - Clean whitespace

### Handling Large Documents

#### Document Size Challenges

Wikipedia articles can be extremely large, and Elasticsearch has practical limits:
- Default http.max_content_length: 100MB
- Lucene hard limit: ~2GB
- Performance degradation with documents over 10MB
- Memory and network stress from large _source fields

#### Chunking Strategy

For optimal performance with large Wikipedia articles, implement a chunking strategy:

**Approach:**
1. Break articles into logical sections (passages)
2. Index as nested documents with relationships preserved
3. Each chunk should be 500-1000 words for optimal search
4. Maintain chunk ordering and article context

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use script processor to split content by sections or paragraphs
- Apply foreach processor to handle variable chunk counts
- Store chunks as nested objects with proper mapping
- Include metadata linking chunks to parent article

**Benefits:**
- Better relevance scoring on specific passages
- Reduced memory usage during search
- Ability to highlight specific relevant sections
- Improved performance for vector similarity search if needed

### Text Analysis Configuration

#### Using the English Analyzer

For this demo, we'll use Elasticsearch's built-in English analyzer which provides excellent results for Wikipedia content:

**English Analyzer Features:**
- Lowercase tokenization
- English stop word removal
- Porter stemming algorithm
- Possessive removal (apostrophe s)

#### Stemming Configuration

Stemming reduces words to their root form, crucial for matching variations:

**Best Practices:**
- Use Porter2 (English) stemmer for better accuracy
- Configure stem_exclusion list for:
  - Proper nouns (cities, people, landmarks)
  - Technical terms that shouldn't be stemmed
  - Acronyms and abbreviations
- Test stemming behavior with actual Wikipedia content
- Consider using hunspell for more precise stemming

**Stem Exclusion Example Categories:**
- Geographic locations: "San Francisco", "California"
- Historical figures: "Washington", "Lincoln"
- Technical terms: "COVID", "NASA"

#### Stop Words Strategy

Stop words removal improves index efficiency but requires careful configuration:

**Recommended Approach:**
- Start with English stop words list
- Remove stop words that carry meaning in encyclopedic context:
  - "who", "what", "when", "where" (important for queries)
  - "not", "no" (negation context)
  - Prepositions that indicate location relationships
- Add domain-specific stop words:
  - Wikipedia editing artifacts ("edit", "citation needed")
  - Common template text

**Configuration Considerations:**
- Stop words significantly reduce index size (30-40% reduction)
- Balance between index efficiency and search precision
- Different stop word lists for indexing vs. query time
- Consider keeping stop words for phrase matching

### Multi-field Mapping Strategy

For comprehensive search capabilities, implement multi-field mapping:

#### Field Configuration

**full_content Field:**
- Type: text
- Analyzer: custom_wikipedia_analyzer
- For full-text search with stemming and stop words

**full_content.exact Field:**
- Type: text  
- Analyzer: standard
- For precise phrase matching without stemming

**full_content.keyword Field:**
- Type: keyword
- For aggregations and exact matching
- Limit with ignore_above for large content

#### Search Strategy

Combine multiple field types for optimal results:
- Main search on full_content with stemming
- Boost exact matches from full_content.exact
- Use full_content.keyword for filters
- Implement cross-field searching for comprehensive results

### Query Time Optimization

#### Full-Text Query Configuration

**Match Query Settings:**
- Use "and" operator for more precise results
- Configure minimum_should_match for partial matches
- Apply fuzziness for typo tolerance
- Set prefix_length to avoid too many false positives

**Highlighting Configuration:**
- Use unified highlighter for large documents
- Configure fragment_size for readable snippets
- Set number_of_fragments based on UI needs
- Use boundary_scanner for sentence boundaries

**Relevance Tuning:**
- Boost title matches over body content
- Apply field-specific boosting
- Use function_score for popularity weighting

### Performance Best Practices

#### Indexing Performance

**Bulk Operations:**
- Use bulk API with 5-10MB per batch
- Process 50-100 documents per bulk request

#### Search Performance

**Basic Optimizations:**
- Avoid leading wildcards
- Use filters instead of queries where possible
- Limit highlighted fields
- Set appropriate number of shards (1-2 for demo)

### Monitoring and Validation

#### Basic Metrics

**Ingestion Metrics:**
- Documents processed successfully
- Failed document count

**Search Validation:**
- Test common Wikipedia queries
- Verify HTML was stripped properly
- Check that search returns expected results

## Conclusion

This simplified implementation leverages Elasticsearch's built-in capabilities for HTML processing and full-text search, perfect for a high-quality demonstration. By using ingest pipelines with the HTML strip processor and the English analyzer, we ensure good search performance for Wikipedia content without unnecessary complexity.

The approach requires minimal changes to the existing data pipeline (adding a filename field) while using Elasticsearch's server-side processing capabilities. This design maintains clean separation of concerns: the data pipeline handles initial metadata loading, Elasticsearch's ingest pipeline processes HTML content, and a simple enrichment script orchestrates the full content loading.

Key benefits of this demo approach:
- **Server-side HTML processing** via ingest pipelines keeps things simple
- **English analyzer** provides excellent results for Wikipedia content  
- **Multi-field mapping** enables different search strategies
- **Simple bulk updates** with pipeline processing
- **Straightforward implementation** that's easy to understand and modify

This implementation provides an excellent demonstration of Elasticsearch's capabilities while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

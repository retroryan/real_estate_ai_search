# Feature Specification: MCP Server Search Service Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-update-the-real`  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Update the real_estate_search/mcp_server/ to use the common real_estate_search/search_service/ and then validate the real_estate_search/mcp_server/ using the real_estate_search/mcp_demos/"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for real estate search, I need the server to utilize the centralized search service instead of implementing its own search logic, so that search functionality is consistent across all interfaces and maintenance is simplified.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP server is running with the search service integration, **When** a client sends a property search request through MCP protocol, **Then** the server delegates the search to the common search service and returns correctly formatted results
2. **Given** the MCP server is integrated with the search service, **When** a client requests neighborhood information, **Then** the server retrieves data from the search service and formats it according to MCP protocol specifications
3. **Given** the MCP demos are configured, **When** running validation tests against the updated MCP server, **Then** all demo scenarios pass successfully with expected search results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the search service is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does system handle malformed search queries from MCP clients?
- What occurs when search results exceed MCP protocol message size limits?
- How does the server handle concurrent search requests from multiple MCP clients?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: MCP server MUST delegate all search operations to the common search service
- **FR-002**: MCP server MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP client interfaces
- **FR-003**: System MUST translate MCP protocol search requests to search service format
- **FR-004**: System MUST format search service responses according to MCP protocol specifications
- **FR-005**: MCP server MUST handle search service errors gracefully and return appropriate MCP error responses
- **FR-006**: Validation suite MUST verify all search functionality through MCP demos
- **FR-007**: MCP server MUST support all search types available in the common search service (properties, neighborhoods,wikipedia)
- **FR-008**: ~~System MUST maintain existing MCP server performance characteristics~~ [NOT REQUIRED: No performance testing needed]
- **FR-009**: MCP server MUST log all search requests and responses for troubleshooting
- **FR-010**: ~~System MUST handle pagination of search results~~ [NOT REQUIRED: No pagination support needed]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Search Request**: MCP protocol formatted search query with criteria and filters
- **Search Response**: Formatted search results including properties, neighborhoods, and metadata
- **Error Response**: Standardized error messages following MCP protocol specifications
- **Search Service Interface**: Contract between MCP server and common search service

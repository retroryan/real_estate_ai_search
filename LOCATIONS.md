# Location Data Integration Proposal

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Update actual methods directly. For example, if there is a class PropertyIndex that needs improvement, do not create ImprovedPropertyIndex - instead update the actual PropertyIndex class
* **PYDANTIC AND MODULAR**: Use Pydantic for type safety, maintain clean modular architecture
* **SIMPLE LOAD AND ENRICH**: Focus on loading and enrichment only, no complex validation steps
* **PROPER STRUCTURE**: Key requirement is to tie neighborhood to city, county, and state, then properties can be tied to neighborhoods via neighborhood_id

## Overview

This proposal outlines how location data from `real_estate_data/locations.json` can be integrated into the existing clean, modular data pipeline architecture. Following the established patterns of entity-specific loaders, processors, and enrichers, location data will serve as a reference dataset to enhance other entities without requiring its own embedding generation.

## Current Location Data Structure

The `locations.json` file contains hierarchical geographic reference data with the following structure:
- **States**: California, Utah (with full names and abbreviations)
- **Counties**: Geographic administrative divisions within states
- **Cities**: Municipal entities within counties
- **Neighborhoods**: Specific areas within cities

Each location entry can contain combinations of:
- `state`: State name or abbreviation (e.g., "CA", "California")
- `county`: County name (e.g., "San Francisco", "Summit County")
- `city`: City name (e.g., "San Francisco", "Park City")
- `neighborhood`: Neighborhood name (e.g., "Mission District", "Old Town")

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. LocationLoader

Following the established loader pattern, create `data_pipeline/loaders/location_loader.py`:

**Purpose**: Load and validate location reference data from JSON files into Spark DataFrames.

**Key Features**:
- Pydantic-based schema validation for type safety
- Spark native JSON loading capabilities
- Data quality validation and normalization
- Hierarchical relationship validation
- Geographic hierarchy enforcement (neighborhood → city → county → state)

**Schema Validation**:
- Ensure geographic hierarchy consistency
- Validate state abbreviations and full names
- Check for duplicate location combinations
- Normalize location name formats (title case, trimming)

### 2. LocationSchema

Create `data_pipeline/schemas/location_schema.py` with Pydantic models:

**LocationSchema**: Primary entity with optional hierarchical fields:
- `state`: Required string field with validation for known states
- `county`: Optional string field normalized to consistent format
- `city`: Optional string field with proper title casing
- `neighborhood`: Optional string field for sub-city areas
- `location_type`: Derived field indicating hierarchy level (state, county, city, neighborhood)
- `full_hierarchy`: Computed field showing complete geographic path
- `normalized_names`: Standardized versions of all location components

**Validation Rules**:
- At minimum, state must be present
- Validate state names against known abbreviations and full names
- Ensure geographic consistency (no orphaned neighborhoods without cities)
- Check for reasonable location name lengths and characters

### 3. LocationEnricher

Create `data_pipeline/enrichment/location_enricher.py`:

**Purpose**: Use location data to enhance other entities through geographic standardization and hierarchy resolution.

**Enhancement Capabilities**:

#### For Properties:
- **Address Standardization**: Normalize city and state fields using canonical location names
- **County Resolution**: Add county information based on city/state combinations
- **Neighborhood Validation**: Verify neighborhood names against known neighborhoods in the city
- **Geographic Completeness**: Calculate completeness scores for location data
- **Location Hierarchy**: Add full geographic path (neighborhood → city → county → state)

#### For Neighborhoods:
- **Boundary Validation**: Verify neighborhood exists in specified city/county
- **Parent Resolution**: Ensure proper city and county associations
- **Name Standardization**: Use canonical neighborhood names
- **Administrative Hierarchy**: Add complete county and state information

#### For Wikipedia Articles:
- **Location Tagging**: Match article locations against canonical location names
- **Geographic Scope**: Identify the most specific geographic level for each article
- **Administrative Context**: Add county and state context for location-based articles
- **Content Relevance**: Score articles for relevance to specific geographic areas

### 4. Integration with Existing Pipeline

**Data Loading Phase**:
- LocationLoader loads reference data early in pipeline execution
- Location DataFrame is broadcast to all nodes for efficient lookups
- Reference data is cached for reuse across entity processing

**Enhancement Phase**:
- LocationEnricher operates after initial entity loading but before embedding generation
- Enrichment happens in parallel for each entity type
- Enhanced location fields are added to entity DataFrames

**Orchestration Updates**:
- Update `DataLoaderOrchestrator` to include LocationLoader
- Location data loaded once and shared across all entity enrichers
- Location DataFrame passed as broadcast variable for memory efficiency

## Data Enhancement Strategies

### 1. Standardization Approach

**Name Normalization**:
- Convert all location names to consistent title case
- Remove extra whitespace and special characters
- Apply standard abbreviation mappings (SF → San Francisco)
- Handle common alternative names and spellings

**Hierarchy Resolution**:
- Use location data to fill missing geographic hierarchy levels
- Validate existing location data against canonical reference
- Flag inconsistent or invalid location combinations
- Provide confidence scores for location matches

### 2. Structural Enhancement

**Geographic Hierarchy Establishment**:
- Create proper neighborhood → city → county → state relationships
- Ensure neighborhoods are tied to their parent city, county, and state
- Enable property listings to reference neighborhoods via neighborhood_id
- Maintain simple hierarchical structure for efficient lookups

### 3. Entity-Specific Enhancements

**Properties**:
- Link properties to neighborhoods via neighborhood_id
- Add missing county information based on city/state
- Standardize location names using canonical reference data
- Enable location-based property grouping and analysis

**Neighborhoods**:
- Establish proper city, county, and state associations
- Add complete geographic hierarchy context
- Ensure neighborhoods have proper parent location references
- Support location-based neighborhood analysis

**Wikipedia Articles**:
- Match article locations against canonical location names
- Add geographic context for location-based articles
- Enable location-specific content organization
- Support geographic content discovery

## Configuration Integration

### YAML Configuration Updates

Add location configuration section to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Location reference data configuration
location_data:
  enabled: true
  path: "real_estate_data/locations.json"
  caching: true  # Cache for reuse across entities
  
  # Enhancement options
  enhancement:
    standardize_names: true
    resolve_hierarchy: true
    establish_relationships: true
```

### Enrichment Configuration

Update entity enrichment configs to include location enhancement:

```yaml
property_enrichment:
  enable_location_enhancement: true
  enable_neighborhood_linking: true
  
neighborhood_enrichment:
  enable_location_hierarchy: true

wikipedia_enrichment:
  enable_location_tagging: true
  add_geographic_context: true
```

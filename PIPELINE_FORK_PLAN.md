# Pipeline Fork Implementation Plan

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC**: All data models must use Pydantic for type safety
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE**: Maintain clear module boundaries and clean architecture

## Architecture Overview

The implementation creates a clean fork in the data pipeline after text processing is complete. At this fork point, data flows into two independent processing paths: one optimized for graph databases and one optimized for search engines. Each path operates independently with its own transformation logic, caching strategy, and write mechanisms.

The key principle is that the fork is explicit and permanent. There is no switching between modes or compatibility layers. The pipeline configuration determines which paths are active, and each path has complete ownership of its processing logic.

## Phase 1: Fork Point Infrastructure

### Objective
Establish the pipeline fork mechanism while maintaining exact current functionality for Neo4j. This phase creates the foundation for dual-path processing without changing any existing behavior.

### Requirements

#### Pipeline Fork Manager
A new PipelineFork class manages the split point in the pipeline. This component receives enriched and text-processed DataFrames and routes them to appropriate processing paths based on configuration. The fork manager provides a simple routing mechanism that directs data to the appropriate path.

The fork manager must provide clear interfaces for path registration and execution. It tracks which paths are active based on configuration. The component ensures clean separation between graph and search processing paths.

#### Configuration Structure
The pipeline configuration must be extended to support fork control. A new fork_configuration section defines which paths are active. Configuration determines whether data flows to graph processing, search processing, or both.

The configuration must support enabling or disabling paths without code changes. Each path can have its own sub-configuration for specific settings. The system must validate configuration consistency at startup.

#### Graph Path Preservation
The existing graph processing path remains completely unchanged. All entity extraction logic continues to function identically. Relationship building operates exactly as before. Neo4j writing uses the current implementation without modifications.

This ensures that Phase 1 introduces no risk to existing functionality. The graph path simply becomes one branch of the fork rather than the entire pipeline. All existing tests must continue to pass without changes.

### Implementation Tasks

1. Create data_pipeline/core/pipeline_fork.py module with PipelineFork class
2. Define ForkConfiguration Pydantic model in data_pipeline/models/fork_models.py
3. Update PipelineConfig to include fork_configuration section
4. Modify pipeline_runner.py to use PipelineFork after text processing
5. Create unit tests for PipelineFork in tests/test_pipeline_fork.py
6. Create integration tests verifying Neo4j path unchanged
7. Document fork configuration in configuration documentation
8. Code review and testing

### Success Criteria

- Neo4j processing produces identical output to current implementation
- All existing tests pass without modification
- Fork introduces minimal overhead when single path active
- Configuration clearly controls path activation
- Clean separation between processing paths

## Phase 2: Elasticsearch Separation and Basic Writing

### Objective
Remove Elasticsearch from the generic writers and create a dedicated search pipeline infrastructure. Implement basic DataFrame writing to Elasticsearch to validate the new architecture.

### Requirements

#### Remove from Writers
The ElasticsearchOrchestrator must be completely removed from data_pipeline/writers/. All references to Elasticsearch in the writer orchestration layer are eliminated. The generic EntityWriter interface no longer includes Elasticsearch-specific methods.

This creates a clean separation between graph-oriented writers and search-oriented processing. The writers directory becomes exclusively focused on graph and analytical outputs. No compatibility shims or adapter patterns are introduced.

#### Search Pipeline Module
A new top-level search_pipeline module is created parallel to data_pipeline. This module has its own models, processors, and writers specific to search. The module structure mirrors data_pipeline for consistency but contains search-optimized implementations.

The search pipeline has complete ownership of search transformations. It defines its own document models using Pydantic. All search-specific logic is contained within this module.

#### Search Pipeline Runner
The SearchPipelineRunner class orchestrates search-specific processing. It receives DataFrames from the fork point and transforms them for search. The runner manages document building, enrichment, and writing to Elasticsearch.

The runner implements lazy evaluation patterns similar to Spark. Transformations are planned but not executed until writing begins. This allows for optimization of the entire search transformation pipeline.

#### Basic Elasticsearch Writer
A new ElasticsearchWriter in search_pipeline/writers/ handles index operations. This writer is specifically designed for search documents, not generic entities. It manages custom mappings, bulk operations, and index lifecycle.

The writer uses the official Elasticsearch Python client for direct control. Bulk indexing is optimized for document structure and size. Index templates and mappings are managed programmatically.

#### Fork Integration
The PipelineFork is updated to support the search path. When search destinations are configured, the fork routes data to SearchPipelineRunner. The search path executes in parallel with the graph path when both are active.

Resource allocation between paths is managed by the fork. Each path can specify its resource requirements. The fork ensures fair allocation and prevents resource starvation.

### Implementation Tasks

1. Delete data_pipeline/writers/elasticsearch/ directory completely
2. Remove Elasticsearch from data_pipeline/writers/orchestrator.py
3. Create search_pipeline/ module structure at top level

### Success Criteria

- Elasticsearch completely removed from data_pipeline/writers/
- Search pipeline successfully indexes basic property data
- Parallel execution works when both paths active
- Clean module separation maintained
- Basic indexing functionality verified

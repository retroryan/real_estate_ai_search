# Common Ingestion API - FastAPI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for creating a FastAPI-based REST API for the Common Ingestion Module. This API will expose the data loading and enrichment capabilities through HTTP endpoints, allowing other services to consume enriched real estate and Wikipedia data.

## Key Implementation Principles

- **Python Naming Conventions**: Follow PEP 8 strictly (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- **Logging Over Print**: Use Python's logging module exclusively, no print statements
- **Constructor-Based Dependency Injection**: All dependencies passed through constructors
- **Modular Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with well-organized module structure
- **Pydantic Models**: All data structures defined as Pydantic models for validation
- **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing (atomic operations)
- **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
- **Demo Quality Focus**: This is for a high-quality demo, not production - skip performance testing, fault-tolerance, benchmarking

## Phase 1: FastAPI Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### Objectives
Establish the FastAPI application structure, dependency injection system, and core middleware components.

### Status: ✅ Completed on 2025-08-23

### Tasks

1. **Create FastAPI Application Structure**
   - [x] Create `common_ingest/api/` directory structure
   - [x] Create `app.py` with FastAPI application instance
   - [x] Create `api_main.py` as separate entry point for API server (keep existing `__main__.py` for data loading testing)
   - [x] Create `dependencies.py` for dependency injection providers
   - [x] Create `middleware.py` for request logging and error handling
   - [x] Set up `routers/` subdirectory for endpoint organization

2. **Configure Dependency Injection**
   - [x] Use FastAPI's `Depends()` system for API-layer dependency injection
   - [x] Create dependency provider functions that instantiate core classes using constructor-based DI
   - [x] Implement singleton pattern for expensive resources (ChromaDB connections) using FastAPI dependency caching
   - [x] Bridge FastAPI `Depends()` with existing constructor-based core classes
   - [x] Maintain separation: core module uses constructor DI, API layer uses FastAPI DI

3. **Set Up Request/Response Models**
   - [x] Create `schemas/` directory for API-specific Pydantic models
   - [x] Define request schemas for filtering parameters
   - [x] Define response schemas that extend enriched models
   - [x] Add pagination and metadata response models

4. **Configure Middleware and Error Handling**
   - [x] Add request logging middleware with correlation IDs
   - [x] Implement global exception handlers
   - [x] Add CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include meaningful error messages

### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "total_count": 420,
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 50,
    "source_timestamp": "2025-08-23T12:00:00Z",
    "enrichment_applied": true
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/v1/properties?page=1",
    "next": "/api/v1/properties?page=2"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_PARAMETER",
    "message": "City 'InvalidCity' not found",
    "details": {
      "parameter": "city",
      "valid_values": ["San Francisco", "Park City", "Oakland"]
    },
    "correlation_id": "abc123"
  }

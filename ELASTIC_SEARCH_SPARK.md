# Complete Cut-Over Requirements:
* COMPLETE CHANGE: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION: Simple, direct replacements only
* NO MIGRATION PHASES: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES: Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED and change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a complete replacement of the current `real_estate_search` ingestion system with a Spark-based Elasticsearch writer integrated into the `data_pipeline` module. The implementation will be a clean, atomic cut-over that directly replaces the existing PropertyIndexer with a unified Spark DataFrame-based approach.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components to Replace

1. **real_estate_search/indexer/property_indexer.py**: 
   - PropertyIndexer class with file-based ingestion
   - Direct Elasticsearch client usage
   - Wikipedia enrichment during indexing
   - Manual bulk operations

2. **real_estate_search/ingestion/**:
   - Orchestrator pattern with multiple loaders
   - File-based processing
   - Custom enrichment pipeline

3. **real_estate_search/infrastructure/elasticsearch_client.py**:
   - Factory pattern for client creation
   - Configuration-based connection management

### Target Architecture

The new system will:
- Use Spark DataFrames as the single data format
- Process all enrichment in the Spark pipeline
- Write directly to Elasticsearch using elasticsearch-spark connector
- Eliminate all file-based intermediate processing

## Implementation Plan

## Running the Implemented Solution (Phases 1-2)

### Prerequisites

1. **Start Elasticsearch**:
```bash
docker run -d --name elasticsearch \
  -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  elasticsearch:8.11.0
```

2. **Verify Elasticsearch is running**:
```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
```

### Running the Pipeline with Elasticsearch Output

1. **Using the elasticsearch_config.yaml**:
```bash
# Run with the Elasticsearch configuration
python -m data_pipeline --config elasticsearch_config.yaml

# Run with subset for testing
DATA_SUBSET_SAMPLE_SIZE=50 python -m data_pipeline --config elasticsearch_config.yaml
```

2. **Verify the output**:
```bash
# Check created indices
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"

# Check document counts
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/realestate_*/_count?pretty"

# Sample a property document
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/realestate_property/_search?size=1&pretty"
```

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run ElasticsearchWriter tests
python -m pytest data_pipeline/tests/unit/test_elasticsearch_writer.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest data_pipeline/tests/unit/test_elasticsearch_writer.py --cov=data_pipeline.writers.elasticsearch_writer
```

## Execution Commands (Future Implementation)

### Running the Complete Pipeline

```bash
# Set environment variables
export ES_HOST=localhost
export ES_PORT=9200

# Run full pipeline with Elasticsearch output
python -m data_pipeline \
    --config config/pipeline_config.yaml \
    --destinations elasticsearch,parquet

# Run with subset for testing
DATA_SUBSET_SAMPLE_SIZE=100 python -m data_pipeline \
    --destinations elasticsearch

# Verify indices
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"

# Check document counts
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/realestate_*/_count"
```

### Direct Replacement Commands

```bash
# Old way (REMOVE):
python -m real_estate_search.ingestion.main --index-properties

# New way (REPLACE WITH):
python -m data_pipeline --destinations elasticsearch
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Unified Processing**: Single Spark pipeline for all data processing
2. **Scalability**: Leverage Spark's distributed processing
3. **Consistency**: Same enriched data across all destinations
4. **Simplicity**: Remove complex file-based orchestration
5. **Performance**: Bulk operations handled by Spark connector
6. **Maintainability**: Single codebase for all data ingestion

## Success Criteria

1. All data successfully indexed in Elasticsearch
2. Search functionality unchanged from user perspective
3. Wikipedia enrichment present in all property documents
4. No intermediate files or temporary storage
5. Single command to run entire pipeline
6. All tests passing with new implementation

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Implement ElasticsearchWriter and integrate with pipeline

# ADVANCED_EMBEDDINGS.md

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of advanced embedding techniques for the `common_embeddings` module: Hierarchical Embeddings and Augmented Embedding Methods. These enhancements will demonstrate state-of-the-art retrieval techniques while maintaining code quality and simplicity.

### Key Goals
* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CREATE "ENHANCED" VERSIONS**: Update existing classes directly
* **CONSISTENT NAMING**: Use snake_case throughout (Python standard)
* **PYDANTIC V2 ONLY**: Use latest Pydantic features without backward compatibility
* **USE LOGGING**: Replace all print statements with proper logging
* **HIGH QUALITY DEMO**: Focus on clean, working code without over-engineering
* **NO MONITORING OVERHEAD**: Skip performance monitoring and schema evolution for simplicity

## Phase 1: Hierarchical Embeddings

### Overview
Implement multi-level embedding strategy where each Wikipedia article has both document-level and chunk-level embeddings, enabling coarse-to-fine retrieval strategies.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Generate document-level embedding from short summary (first 100-200 words)
- Generate document-level embedding from long summary (first 500-1000 words)
- Maintain existing chunk-level embeddings for detailed retrieval
- Store all three embedding types in the same ChromaDB collection with clear metadata distinction
- Enable hybrid search that combines document and chunk scores
- Support configurable weighting between different embedding levels

#### Technical Requirements
- Modify existing pipeline to generate multiple embedding types per document
- Update metadata schema to distinguish embedding levels
- Implement retrieval strategy that leverages hierarchy
- Ensure all embeddings use the same model for consistency
- Maintain efficient storage without duplication

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1.1: Data Preparation
- Review existing summary extraction in wikipedia loader
- Ensure both short and long summaries are available for each article
- Validate summary quality and completeness
- Create clear truncation boundaries for consistency

#### Phase 1.2: Pipeline Modification
- Update EmbeddingPipeline to generate three embedding types per document
- Modify chunking strategy to work alongside document embeddings
- Update metadata structures to include embedding_level field
- Ensure proper document ID management across all levels

#### Phase 1.3: Storage Updates
- Modify ChromaDB storage to handle multiple embeddings per document
- Update collection schema with embedding level metadata
- Implement efficient retrieval for specific embedding levels
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing chunk-only collections

#### Phase 1.4: Retrieval Strategy
- Implement two-stage retrieval: document filtering then chunk ranking
- Create weighted scoring mechanism combining all levels
- Add configuration for retrieval strategy selection
- Optimize query performance with proper indexing

#### Phase 1.5: Evaluation
- Create specific test queries for hierarchical retrieval
- Measure performance improvements for broad vs specific queries
- Compare retrieval speed with and without hierarchy
- Document optimal weight configurations

### Expected Outcomes
- 30-50% faster initial retrieval for broad queries
- Improved relevance for abstract or conceptual queries
- Maintained precision for specific detail queries
- Clear demonstration of multi-level retrieval benefits

### Success Criteria
- All Wikipedia articles have three embedding types
- Retrieval latency improves by at least 20% for broad queries
- No degradation in precision for specific queries
- Clean, maintainable implementation without code duplication

## Phase 2: Augmented Embedding Methods

### Overview
Enhance chunk embeddings by prepending contextual information from the parent document, improving retrieval quality for context-dependent queries.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Prepend each chunk with document title and summary
- Include relevant metadata (categories, location, key topics)
- Support configurable context window sizes
- Implement smart truncation to maintain embedding size limits
- Create side-by-side comparison with traditional chunks
- Maintain separate collections for augmented vs traditional

#### Technical Requirements
- Modify chunking process to create augmented text
- Ensure augmented chunks fit within model token limits
- Update pipeline to support both traditional and augmented modes
- Implement efficient context prepending without redundancy
- Maintain clear separation between methods

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 2.1: Context Extraction
- Extract relevant context from document metadata
- Create consistent context format for all chunks
- Implement smart summarization for long contexts
- Validate context quality and relevance

#### Phase 2.2: Augmented Chunking
- Modify chunking module to support augmented mode
- Implement context prepending logic
- Add truncation strategy for size limits
- Ensure chunk boundaries remain meaningful

#### Phase 2.3: Pipeline Integration
- Add configuration flag for augmented mode
- Update processing pipeline to handle both modes
- Ensure proper metadata tracking for augmented chunks
- Maintain clear separation in storage

#### Phase 2.4: Comparison Framework
- Create evaluation queries sensitive to context
- Implement side-by-side evaluation
- Generate comparison reports
- Document performance differences

#### Phase 2.5: Optimization
- Fine-tune context window sizes
- Optimize truncation strategies
- Balance context vs content ratio
- Document best practices

### Expected Outcomes
- 15-25% improvement in recall for context-dependent queries
- Better handling of ambiguous search terms
- Improved cross-document reference resolution
- Clear demonstration of context benefits

### Success Criteria
- Augmented embeddings show measurable improvement
- No significant increase in storage requirements
- Clean separation between traditional and augmented methods
- Professional comparison reports generated

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Validate data transformations
- Ensure metadata integrity
- Check embedding dimensions

### Integration Testing
- Test full pipeline with both methods
- Validate storage and retrieval
- Ensure configuration switching works
- Check performance metrics

### Performance Testing
- Measure embedding generation speed
- Test retrieval latency
- Monitor memory usage

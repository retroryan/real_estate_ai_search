## Notes

- Demos with 0 results may need more data loaded for those specific locations/criteria
- Demo 10 (Property Relationships) appears to need the denormalized index to be built
- Demo 12 runs multiple example queries in sequence
- Demo 27 runs multiple location-aware demos as a showcase

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test basic search
./es-manager.sh demo 1

# Test hybrid search
./es-manager.sh demo 15

# Test location-aware search
./es-manager.sh demo 19

# Run the showcase (multiple demos)
./es-manager.sh demo 27
```

## Troubleshooting

If demos return 0 results:
1. Check that Elasticsearch is running: `./es-manager.sh health`
2. Verify data is loaded: `./es-manager.sh stats`
3. Rebuild indices if needed: `./es-manager.sh rebuild`

For location-aware demos (17-26), ensure:
- DSPy is configured properly
- Location extraction service is working
- Properties exist in the specified cities (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Salinas)

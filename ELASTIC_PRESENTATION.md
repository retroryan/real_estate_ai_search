## Slide 3: Project Overview - Real Estate RAG System
**Building an Intelligent Property Search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

- **Primary Goal:** Create a high-quality RAG pipeline that ingests synthetic property and neighborhood data alongside real Wikipedia content for AI-powered property discovery
- **Data Sources:** Synthetic properties with rich attributes and 10-year price history, synthetic neighborhoods with demographics and trends, scraped Wikipedia articles for real-world context, and geographic boundaries
- **Advanced Search:** Rich property listing search by neighborhood characteristics, semantic understanding of natural language queries, geographic radius and polygon searches, and historical price trend analysis
- **AI Integration:** Dense embeddings for semantic understanding, natural language query interpretation, hybrid search combining text and vectors, and context retrieval for LLM augmentation
- **Business Value:** Demonstrates production RAG architecture with synthetic data, enables complex multi-criteria property discovery, showcases Elasticsearch's versatility for real estate applications, and scalable to millions of listings

*Summary: A production-ready RAG system using synthetic property data and real Wikipedia content to demonstrate sophisticated AI-powered search capabilities*

## Slide 4: Data Processing Pipeline Flow
**From Raw Data to Searchable Knowledge Graph**

- **Index Preparation:** Creates four core indices (properties, neighborhoods, wikipedia, relationships) with custom mappings for text, dense vectors, and geo-points using predefined templates
- **Document Enrichment:** Calculates price per square foot and generates search tags, creates 10-year historical price trends using deterministic algorithms, and embeds neighborhood context directly into property documents
- **Wikipedia Processing:** Processes complete articles without chunking, generates embeddings from title and summary concatenation, and links articles to neighborhoods for geographic context
- **Historical Data Generation:** Creates synthetic 10-year price history (2015-2024) with 5% base appreciation, applies property-specific variations using hash-based seeding, and maintains consistent neighborhood-property price relationships
- **Quality Validation:** Validates data completeness and type correctness, ensures historical data structure integrity, verifies embedding presence for all documents, and confirms Elasticsearch mapping compatibility

*Summary: DuckDB-powered medallion architecture transforms synthetic property data and real Wikipedia content into a search-optimized knowledge graph*

## Slide 5: Data Ingestion Architecture
**SQUACK Pipeline - Medallion Architecture for Reliable Processing**

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion from JSON sources preserving original structure, handles properties, neighborhoods, and Wikipedia articles with fault tolerance
- **Silver Layer:** Data standardization with consistent formatting, validation rules enforcement, duplicate removal, and field normalization across sources
- **Gold Layer:** Business logic enrichment calculating derived metrics, geospatial computations for location intelligence, and relationship mapping between entities
- **Embedding Generation:** Batch processing through Voyage/OpenAI/Gemini APIs, 1024-dimensional vectors for semantic search, with rate limiting and retry logic
- **Elasticsearch Loading:** Bulk indexing with optimized batch sizes, temporary index settings for maximum throughput, and post-processing for relationship denormalization

*Summary: A robust medallion architecture ensures data quality through progressive refinement from raw ingestion to search-ready documents*

---

## Slide 6: Embedding Generation
**Creating Semantic Search Vectors from Structured Data**

- **Property Embeddings:** Concatenates key property attributes including description, features, address, buyer persona, and amenities into a single text string for embedding generation
- **Neighborhood Embeddings:** Combines neighborhood description, name, population, median income, and community features using pipe delimiters to create rich semantic representation
- **Wikipedia Embeddings:** Uses article title combined with DSPy-generated long summary to create embedding text, ensuring semantic relevance to real estate context
- **Pluggable Provider Architecture:** Supports multiple embedding providers (Voyage AI as primary with 1024-dim vectors, OpenAI text-embedding-3 with 1536-dim, Ollama for local processing with 768-dim)
- **Batch Processing:** Optimized batch sizes per provider (Voyage: 10 texts, OpenAI: 100 texts, Ollama: 1 text) with automatic retry logic and rate limiting

*Summary: Flexible embedding generation system transforms text aggregations into dense vectors optimized for semantic search across different data types*

---

## Slide 7: Bulk Indexing with Elasticsearch
**High-Performance Data Loading with Elasticsearch Bulk API**

- **Wikipedia Summarization:** Articles are first summarized using a Micro AI Agent with DSPy for relevance scoring and content extraction
- **Streaming Architecture:** DuckDB streams results in configurable batches (100 documents default) directly to Elasticsearch without loading entire dataset into memory
- **Document Transformation:** Pydantic models validate and transform each record before indexing, ensuring type safety and data consistency
- **Bulk Action Generation:** Each document converted to bulk action with index name, document ID, and source data structured for Elasticsearch's bulk API format
- **Error Handling:** Non-blocking bulk operations with detailed error logging, validation error tracking, and automatic retry for transient failures
- **Performance Optimization:** Sequential batch processing with configurable batch sizes (100 docs default), progress monitoring (logs every 1000 documents), and index configured with 0 replicas during loading to reduce write overhead

```python
# Example from squack_pipeline_v2/writers/elastic/base.py
actions = []
for record in batch_data:  # Process batch of 100 documents
    document = transform(record)  # Pydantic validation
    doc = document.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
    action = {
        "_index": index_name,
        "_id": doc[id_field],
        "_source": doc
    }
    actions.append(action)

# Bulk index entire batch
result = bulk(es_client, actions, raise_on_error=False)
```

*Summary: Efficient bulk indexing pipeline streams millions of documents from DuckDB to Elasticsearch with validation, error handling, and performance monitoring*

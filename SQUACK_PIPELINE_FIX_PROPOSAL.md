# SQUACK Pipeline Fix Proposal - Demo Implementation

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **ALWAYS FIX THE CORE ISSUE!** - Address the fundamental problem of unnecessary flattening and reconstruction
* **COMPLETE CHANGE:** All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update per phase
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION:** Simple, direct replacements only - no complex workarounds
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES:** Do not create temporary compatibility periods between old and new structures
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES:** Change everything in a layer or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS:** Do not maintain old flattened and new nested paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE:** Do not comment out old flattening code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION:** Do not duplicate functions to handle both flattened and nested patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS:** Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers for compatibility
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED:** Always update the actual methods directly. For example, update PropertyLoader directly, do not create ImprovedPropertyLoader
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC:** All data models must use Pydantic for validation and type safety
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE:** Organize code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
* **NO hasattr USAGE:** Never use hasattr for checking capabilities - use proper interfaces
* **NO VARIABLE CASTING:** Never cast variables or create variable name aliases
* **FIX CORE ISSUES:** If something doesn't work, fix the root cause - don't hack or mock around it
* **ASK QUESTIONS:** If there are uncertainties, seek clarification before proceeding

## Executive Summary

The SQUACK pipeline demo currently flattens all nested data structures in the Bronze layer, then reconstructs them in the Gold layer for Elasticsearch. This is unnecessary work - Elasticsearch expects nested objects. This proposal fixes the pipeline to preserve nested structures throughout, making it simpler and more efficient.

## Problem Statement

The pipeline unnecessarily:
1. Flattens nested JSON in Bronze layer
2. Reconstructs nested objects in Gold layer for Elasticsearch
3. Creates complexity that doesn't need to exist

## Solution

Preserve nested structures throughout the pipeline - Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers should all maintain the natural nested structure of the data.

5. **Clean cutover** - Remove old code completely, no compatibility layers

# Neighborhood Model Cleanup - COMPLETED

## What Was Removed

### From Neighborhood Model (`real_estate_search/models/neighborhood.py`)

**Removed these unused fields:**
- `boundaries` field - Was not used anywhere
- `area_sqmi` field - Was not used anywhere  
- `crime_rate` field - Was not used anywhere (only appeared in one demo schema file)
- Import of `GeographicBoundaries` from geojson module - No longer needed

**Kept these fields (they are actively used):**
- `overall_livability_score` - Calculated in pipeline and used
- `avg_price` - Used in 32+ files for analytics
- `avg_price_per_sqft` - Used in market analysis  
- `property_count` - Used as calculated field in analytics

### Complete File Removal

**Delete this entire file:**
- `real_estate_search/models/geojson.py` - All classes unused:
  - GeoJSONPoint
  - GeoJSONPolygon
  - GeoJSONMultiPolygon
  - GeoJSONBoundingBox
  - GeographicBoundaries

## Why It's Safe to Remove

**For the fields being removed:**
- Not used in any code
- Not in Elasticsearch mappings
- Not in actual data files
- No tests use them

**For the fields being kept:**
- They are actively used in analytics and calculations
- Removing them would break existing functionality

## Notes

The methods `has_good_schools()` and `is_walkable()` mentioned don't exist in the code, so there's nothing to remove.

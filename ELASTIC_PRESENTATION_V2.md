## Slide 4: Data Processing Pipeline Flow
**From Raw Data to Searchable Knowledge Graph**

- **Index Preparation:** Creates four core indices (properties, neighborhoods, wikipedia, relationships) with custom mappings for text, dense vectors, and geo-points using predefined templates
- **Document Enrichment:** Calculates price per square foot and generates search tags, creates 10-year historical price trends using deterministic algorithms, and embeds neighborhood context directly into property documents
- **Wikipedia Processing:** Processes complete articles without chunking, generates embeddings from title and summary concatenation, and links articles to neighborhoods for geographic context
- **Historical Data Generation:** Creates synthetic 10-year price history (2015-2024) with 5% base appreciation, applies property-specific variations using hash-based seeding, and maintains consistent neighborhood-property price relationships
- **Quality Validation:** Validates data completeness and type correctness, ensures historical data structure integrity, verifies embedding presence for all documents, and confirms Elasticsearch mapping compatibility

*Summary: DuckDB-powered medallion architecture transforms synthetic property data and real Wikipedia content into a search-optimized knowledge graph*

*Summary: A robust medallion architecture ensures data quality through progressive refinement from raw ingestion to search-ready documents*

---

## Slide 6: Embedding Generation
**Creating Semantic Search Vectors from Structured Data**

- **Property Embeddings:** Concatenates key property attributes including description, features, address, buyer persona, and amenities into a single text string for embedding generation
- **Neighborhood Embeddings:** Combines neighborhood description, name, population, median income, and community features using pipe delimiters to create rich semantic representation
- **Wikipedia Embeddings:** Uses article title combined with DSPy-generated long summary to create embedding text, ensuring semantic relevance to real estate context
- **Pluggable Provider Architecture:** Supports multiple embedding providers (Voyage AI as primary with 1024-dim vectors, OpenAI text-embedding-3 with 1536-dim, Ollama for local processing with 768-dim)
- **Batch Processing:** Optimized batch sizes per provider (Voyage: 10 texts, OpenAI: 100 texts, Ollama: 1 text) with automatic retry logic and rate limiting

*Summary: Flexible embedding generation system transforms text aggregations into dense vectors optimized for semantic search across different data types*

---

## Slide 7: Bulk Indexing with Elasticsearch
**High-Performance Data Loading with Elasticsearch Bulk API**

- **Wikipedia Summarization:** Articles are first summarized using a Micro AI Agent with DSPy for relevance scoring and content extraction
- **Streaming Architecture:** DuckDB streams results in configurable batches (100 documents default) directly to Elasticsearch without loading entire dataset into memory
- **Document Transformation:** Pydantic models validate and transform each record before indexing, ensuring type safety and data consistency
- **Bulk Action Generation:** Each document converted to bulk action with index name, document ID, and source data structured for Elasticsearch's bulk API format
- **Error Handling:** Non-blocking bulk operations with detailed error logging, validation error tracking, and automatic retry for transient failures
- **Performance Optimization:** Sequential batch processing with configurable batch sizes (100 docs default), progress monitoring (logs every 1000 documents), and index configured with 0 replicas during loading to reduce write overhead

```python
# Example from squack_pipeline_v2/writers/elastic/base.py
actions = []
for record in batch_data:  # Process batch of 100 documents
    document = transform(record)  # Pydantic validation
    doc = document.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
    action = {
        "_index": index_name,
        "_id": doc[id_field],
        "_source": doc
    }
    actions.append(action)

# Bulk index entire batch
result = bulk(es_client, actions, raise_on_error=False)
```

*Summary: Efficient bulk indexing pipeline streams millions of documents from DuckDB to Elasticsearch with validation, error handling, and performance monitoring*

---

## Slide 26: Index Templates with Embeddings
**Unified Configuration for AI-Powered Search**

Templates ensure consistent vector field mappings and k-NN settings across indices, enabling scalable semantic search deployments.

```python
{
  "index_patterns": ["properties*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index.knn": true,
      "index.knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "embedding": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 1024,
          "index": true,
          "similarity": "cosine"
        },
        "description": {"type": "text"},
        "price": {"type": "float"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Benefits:*
- Automatic k-NN and embedding configuration for new indices
- Consistent vector dimensions and similarity metrics across deployments

- Version-controlled AI search capabilities alongside traditional mappings
- Ensures compatibility between embedding generation and search operations

---

## Slide 10: Vector Search (k-NN)
**Semantic Similarity Using Dense Embeddings**

Nearest neighbor search enables semantic understanding, finding properties based on meaning rather than exact keywords, powered by 1024-dimensional embeddings.

```python
{
    "knn": {
        "field": "embedding_vector",
        "query_vector": query_embedding,
        "k": 10,
        "num_candidates": 100
    }
}
```

*Capabilities:*
- Voyage AI embeddings capture semantic meaning
- Finds "cozy family home" without exact matches
- 100 candidates ensure quality results

---

## Slide 11: Hybrid Search (RRF)
**Combining Text and Vector for Optimal Results**

Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges keyword precision with semantic understanding, delivering superior search results by leveraging both BM25 and vector similarities.

```python
{
    "retriever": {
        "rrf": {
            "retrievers": [
                {
                    "standard": {
                        "query": text_query
                    }
                },
                {
                    "knn": vector_config
                }
            ],
            "rank_constant": 60  # Controls ranking fusion behavior
        }
    }
}
```

*RRF Algorithm & Parameters:*
- **rank_constant (k):** Controls how much to favor top-ranked results (default 60)
  - Higher k (100+): More even distribution of scores, less bias toward top results
  - Lower k (20-40): Heavily favors top-ranked items from each retriever
  - Formula: score = 1/(k + rank_position)
- **How it works:** Each retriever produces ranked results, RRF combines using reciprocal rank formula, final score is sum of individual RRF scores
- Native Elasticsearch 8.16+ implementation for performance

## Slide 13: Natural Language Query Processing
**AI-Powered Query Understanding with DSPy**

DSPy micro-agents extract location intent and property features from natural language, transforming conversational queries into structured Elasticsearch DSL using Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

```python
# DSPy LocationExtractionSignature fields:
class LocationExtractionSignature(dspy.Signature):
    query_text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Natural language search query")
    city: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted city or 'unknown'")
    state: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted state or 'unknown'")
    neighborhood: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted neighborhood")
    has_location: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="True if location found")
    cleaned_query: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Query with location removed")
    confidence: float = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extraction confidence 0-1")

# Example: "Modern kitchen in San Francisco near parks"
# Extracts: city="San Francisco", cleaned_query="Modern kitchen near parks"
{
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
                "match": {
                    "address.city": "San Francisco"
                }
            },
            {
                "multi_match": {
                    "query": "Modern kitchen near parks"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

*DSPy Processing Pipeline:*

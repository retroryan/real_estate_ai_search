---

## Slide 26: Index Templates with Embeddings
**Defining the Embedding Field for Semantic Search**

The properties template defines a dense_vector field for storing embeddings, enabling semantic similarity search capabilities.

```json
// From real_estate_search/elasticsearch/templates/properties.json
{
  "embedding": {
    "type": "dense_vector",
    "dims": 1024,
    "similarity": "cosine"
  }
}
```

*Benefits:*
- Defines embedding field for storing vector representations
- Enables semantic similarity search using k-NN with HNSW algorithm

---

## Slide 10: Vector Search (k-NN)
**Semantic Similarity Using Dense Embeddings**

Nearest neighbor search enables semantic understanding, finding properties based on meaning rather than exact keywords

```python
{
    "knn": {
        "field": "embedding_vector",
        "query_vector": query_embedding,
        "k": 10,
        "num_candidates": 100
    }
}
```

*Capabilities:*
- Voyage AI embeddings capture semantic meaning
- Finds "cozy family home" without exact matches
- 100 candidates ensure quality results

---

## Slide 11: Hybrid Search (RRF)
**Combining Text and Vector for Optimal Results**

Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges keyword precision with semantic understanding, delivering superior search results by leveraging both BM25 and vector similarities.

```python
{
    "retriever": {
        "rrf": {
            "retrievers": [
                {
                    "standard": {
                        "query": text_query
                    }
                },
                {
                    "knn": vector_config
                }
            ],
            "rank_constant": 60  # Controls ranking fusion behavior
        }
    }
}
```
- **How it works:** Each retriever produces ranked results, RRF combines using reciprocal rank formula, final score is sum of individual RRF scores
---

## Slide 13: Natural Language Query Processing
**AI-Powered Query Understanding with DSPy**

DSPy micro-agents extract location intent and property features from natural language, transforming conversational queries into structured Elasticsearch DSL using Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

```python
# DSPy LocationExtractionSignature fields:
class LocationExtractionSignature(dspy.Signature):
    query_text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Natural language search query")
    city: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted city or 'unknown'")
    state: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted state or 'unknown'")
    neighborhood: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted neighborhood")
    has_location: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="True if location found")
    cleaned_query: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Query with location removed")
    confidence: float = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extraction confidence 0-1")

# Example: "Modern kitchen in San Francisco near parks"
# Extracts: city="San Francisco", cleaned_query="Modern kitchen near parks"
{
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
                "match": {
                    "address.city": "San Francisco"
                }
            },
            {
                "multi_match": {
                    "query": "Modern kitchen near parks"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

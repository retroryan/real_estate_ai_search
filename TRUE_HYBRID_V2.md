## System Requirements

### Technical Prerequisites

The system requires the following components to be in place:

1. **Elasticsearch 8.11 or higher** - Required for native RRF support
2. **Dense vector field mapping** - 1024-dimensional embeddings using Voyage-3 model
3. **Geo-point field mapping** - address.location field with latitude/longitude coordinates
4. **DSPy framework** - For structured information extraction and location understanding
5. **Pydantic models** - For strict type validation and data modeling

### Functional Requirements

The system must support the following query patterns:

1. **Natural language location queries** - Understanding phrases like "near Golden Gate Park" or "walking distance to downtown"
2. **Combined semantic and keyword search** - Leveraging both vector similarity and text matching
3. **Geo-spatial filtering** - Converting natural language to geo-distance queries
4. **Landmark and POI recognition** - Identifying known places and their coordinates
5. **Proximity understanding** - Interpreting terms like "near", "close to", "walking distance"

---

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The architecture consists of three main components working together:

1. **Hybrid Search Engine** - Orchestrates the combination of vector and text search with RRF
2. **Location Understanding Service** - Uses DSPy to extract and interpret location intent
3. **Query Processor** - Prepares queries by separating location intent from property features

### Data Flow

The system processes queries through the following stages:

1. **Query Reception** - User submits a natural language query
2. **Location Extraction** - DSPy signatures identify location-related components
3. **Query Decomposition** - Separate location constraints from property features
4. **Parallel Search Execution** - Run vector and text searches simultaneously
5. **RRF Fusion** - Combine results using reciprocal rank fusion
6. **Result Enrichment** - Add distance and relevance metadata

---

## Location-Aware Hybrid Search Design

### Query Understanding Pipeline

The system will process natural language queries to extract both semantic intent and location constraints. This involves:

1. **Intent Classification** - Determine if the query contains location information
2. **Entity Extraction** - Identify specific locations using existing data only
3. **Constraint Generation** - Convert location intent to Elasticsearch geo queries
4. **Query Cleaning** - Remove location terms from the main search query

### Hybrid Search Execution

The hybrid search combines multiple search strategies:

1. **Text Search Component**
   - Multi-match query across description, features, and amenities fields
   - Field boosting for relevance tuning
   - Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
   - BM25 scoring for traditional relevance

2. **Vector Search Component**
   - KNN search using 1024-dimensional embeddings
   - Cosine similarity for semantic matching
   - Query vector generation using Voyage-3 model
   - Semantic understanding of property features

3. **Location Filter Component**
   - Geo-distance queries for radius searches using existing property coordinates
   - Area filtering based on existing neighborhood data
   - Distance-based result ranking

### Reciprocal Rank Fusion

The system uses Elasticsearch's native RRF to combine results following 2024 best practices:

1. **RRF Retriever Configuration** - Uses modern retriever syntax (GA in 8.16+)
2. **Result Processing** - Elasticsearch handles RRF computation automatically using proven formula: score = Σ(1 / (k + rank_i))
3. **Parameter Configuration** - Uses standard rank_constant=60 and configurable rank_window_size
4. **Native Integration** - Leverages Elasticsearch's optimized RRF implementation

## DSPy Location Understanding

### Signature-Based Extraction

Following the successful pattern from wiki_summary, the system will use DSPy signatures for location understanding:

#### Location Intent Signature

The signature will extract location information from natural language queries with the following fields:

**Input Fields:**
- query_text: The full natural language search query
- known_landmarks: Database of recognized landmarks and POIs
- known_neighborhoods: List of neighborhood names and boundaries

**Output Fields:**
- primary_location: Main location reference identified
- location_type: Classification of location (landmark, neighborhood, address, etc.)
- proximity_modifier: Terms like "near", "walking distance", "close to"
- distance_constraint: Interpreted distance in standardized units
- geo_coordinates: Latitude and longitude if identifiable
- confidence_score: Reliability of the extraction

#### Implementation Pattern

The implementation follows the wiki_summary extract agent pattern:

1. **Module Initialization** - Create DSPy module with ChainOfThought for better reasoning
2. **Synchronous Processing** - Use only synchronous DSPy methods, no async operations
3. **Result Validation** - Validate extracted fields using Pydantic models
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation when location cannot be identified

### Location Data Usage

The system uses only existing data for simple location extraction:

1. **Basic Location Extraction**
   - Extract city, state, county, neighborhood, and zip code from queries
   - Examples: "Find a great family home in Park City", "Houses in San Francisco", "Properties in 94102"
   - Use existing address fields: address.city, address.state, address.zip_code, neighborhood.name

2. **Simple Pattern Matching**
   - Basic DSPy signature to identify location patterns in queries
   - Filter properties by matching location data in existing index fields
   - Clean, minimal approach using only available property data

### Natural Language Patterns

The system recognizes simple location patterns using existing data:

1. **Basic Location Patterns**
   - "in [city]" - Match properties in specific city
   - "in [neighborhood]" - Match neighborhood.name field
   - "in [zip_code]" - Match address.zip_code field
   - "[state] properties" - Match address.state field

2. **Simple Filtering**
   - Extract location terms using DSPy signature
   - Apply as filters to Elasticsearch queries
   - Use existing indexed location fields only

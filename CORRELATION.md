# CORRELATION.md: Complete Integration Plan for Moving Correlation Functionality to Common Ingest

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan to integrate correlation functionality into `common_ingest/` to enrich data with embeddings from existing ChromaDB collections created by `common_embeddings/`.

### Primary Goal
**Provide unified API endpoints that return real estate and Wikipedia data enriched with their pre-computed embeddings from ChromaDB collections in a single, elegant interface.**

### Architecture Clarification
- **common_embeddings/**: Creates and populates ChromaDB collections with embeddings for properties, neighborhoods, and Wikipedia data
- **common_ingest/**: Reads existing ChromaDB collections and correlates embeddings with source data during the enrichment phase

### Current State Analysis
The `common_ingest/` module currently provides:
- **Working API endpoints** for properties and neighborhoods with pagination and filtering
- **Service layer architecture** with dependency injection already in place
- **Pydantic models** from property_finder_models for type safety
- **Enrichment capabilities** for address normalization and feature deduplication
- **TODO placeholders** for embedding inclusion (6 locations across properties.py and wikipedia.py)

The `common_embeddings/` module has already:
- **Created ChromaDB collections** with embeddings for all entity types
- **Stored metadata** (listing_id, neighborhood_id, page_id) for correlation
- **Implemented chunking** for large documents with chunk indices
- **Populated collections** named like "embeddings_nomic-embed-text"

### Core Requirements
1. **Read Existing Collections**: Connect to ChromaDB collections created by common_embeddings
2. **Correlation Logic**: Match embeddings to source data using metadata (listing_id, neighborhood_id, page_id)
3. **Unified Data Access**: Single API call returns data WITH correlated embeddings
4. **Demo Quality**: Clean, simple implementation focused on demonstrating capabilities
5. **Atomic Operations**: All changes must be complete - no partial updates
6. **Clean Architecture**: Service layer pattern with constructor-based dependency injection
7. **Python Standards**: Logging only (no print), PEP 8 naming, Pydantic validation

### Target Architecture
The correlation functionality will integrate into common_ingest's service layer:
- **Embedding Service**: Reads from existing ChromaDB collections using bulk operations
- **Correlation Service**: Matches embeddings to source data via metadata identifiers
- **Enrichment Service**: Combines source data with correlated embeddings
- **Extended API Endpoints**: Return enriched data with embeddings in single response
- **Unified Response Models**: Pydantic models combining source data with vectors

### ChromaDB Integration Strategy
Following best practices from ChromaDB documentation:
- Use `.get()` with metadata filtering for bulk retrieval
- Filter by entity_type and identifiers (listing_id, neighborhood_id, page_id)
- Retrieve embeddings, metadata, and documents in single operation
- Handle multi-chunk documents using chunk_index metadata
- Optimize with proper where clauses for efficient filtering

## Key Implementation Principles

- **Python Naming Conventions**: Follow PEP 8 strictly (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- **Logging Over Print**: Use Python's logging module exclusively, no print statements
- **Constructor-Based Dependency Injection**: All dependencies passed through constructors
- **Modular Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with well-organized module structure
- **Pydantic Models**: All data structures defined as Pydantic models for validation
- **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing (atomic operations)
- **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
- **Demo Quality Focus**: This is for a high-quality demo, not production - skip performance testing, fault-tolerance, benchmarking
- **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: There does not need to be any backwards compatibility

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Correlation Components in common_embeddings/

1. **Models** (`correlation/models.py`):
   - `SourceDataCache`: Caching for source data with hit/miss tracking
   - `CorrelationResult`: Result of correlating embedding with source
   - `EnrichedEntity`: Entity enriched with embedding data
   - `CorrelationReport`: Comprehensive correlation operation report
   - `BulkCorrelationRequest`: Request configuration for bulk operations

2. **Correlation Manager** (`correlation/correlation_manager.py`):
   - Core correlation logic between embeddings and source data
   - Identifier extraction based on entity type
   - Source data loading from JSON files and SQLite
   - Bulk correlation with parallel processing
   - Multi-chunk document reconstruction

3. **Enrichment Engine** (`correlation/enrichment_engine.py`):
   - Entity-specific enrichment processors
   - Parallel bulk enrichment capabilities
   - Property, neighborhood, and Wikipedia-specific enrichments
   - Similarity search integration points

### Target State in common_ingest/

The correlation functionality will be fully integrated into `common_ingest/` as:
- New services layer for correlation and enrichment
- Extended API endpoints with embedding correlation
- Unified response models with embedded vectors
- Integrated caching and performance optimization

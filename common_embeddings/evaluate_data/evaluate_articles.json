The oil threatened sensitive habitats, including the Bolinas Lagoon, and had a devastating impact on local wildlife, particularly birds. An estimated 7,000 birds were oiled, with most perishing despite rescue efforts. The disaster galvanized the community, leading to one of the largest volunteer turnouts since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. These efforts laid the groundwork for the establishment of the International Bird Rescue, an organization dedicated to improving bird rescue techniques. The spill also heightened public awareness of environmental issues and pollution, contributing to the growth of environmental activism in the region.

Initially used for livestock grazing and logging, the area's economic focus shifted dramatically with the discovery of gold and silver ore in 1863. The completion of the Bingham Canyon and Camp Floyd Rail Road in 1873 further spurred mining activity, with the focus eventually shifting to the high-quality copper ores in the district. The town experienced its greatest boom in the early 20th century, particularly after Daniel C. Jackling organized the Utah Copper Company in 1903 to begin surface mining. This led to a significant influx of residents, and Bingham Canyon was officially incorporated on February 29, 1904. At its peak, the town had around 15,000 residents. However, the very mines that brought prosperity also led to the town's demise. By the mid-20th century, the expanding Bingham Canyon Mine began encroaching on the town, forcing residents to relocate. By the 1970s, the town had been entirely consumed by the mine, and the remaining residents voted to disincorporate. Today, no trace of Bingham Canyon remains, but the Bingham Canyon Mine, one of the largest open-pit mines in the world, stands as a testament to the area's rich mining history.",

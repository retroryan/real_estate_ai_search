      "long_summary": "The Fillmore District is a historical neighborhood in San Francisco located to the southwest of Nob Hill, west of Market Street and north of the Mission District. It has been given various nicknames such as 'the Moe' or 'the Fill'. The Fillmore District began to rise to prominence after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. As a result of not being affected by the earthquake itself nor the large fires that resulted, it quickly became one of the major commercial and cultural centers of the city. After the earthquake, the district experienced a large influx of diverse ethnic populations. It began to house large numbers of African Americans, Japanese and Jews. Each group significantly contributed to the local culture and earned the Fillmore district a reputation for being 'One of the most diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco'. In particular, the district became known as 'the Harlem of the West' during the 1940s and 1950s for its vibrant African American jazz scene.",

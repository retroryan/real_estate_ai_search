# Integration Tests Proposal - Common Embeddings Module

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive ChromaDB-focused integration testing strategy for the Common Embeddings Module that validates storage, retrieval, and query operations using real-world datasets. The tests will use actual data from the project's real estate JSON files and Wikipedia SQLite database to ensure ChromaDB operations perform correctly with production-like workloads and data volumes.

## Testing Philosophy

### Real Data-Driven ChromaDB Testing
These integration tests focus exclusively on ChromaDB storage and retrieval operations using the project's actual datasets:
- **220 real estate properties** from San Francisco and Park City
- **11 neighborhoods** with rich demographic and amenity data  
- **557 Wikipedia articles** about Utah and California locations
- **Processed summaries** with confidence scores and location extraction

### ChromaDB-Focused Validation
Each test validates ChromaDB-specific operations:
1. Collection management and organization
2. Metadata storage with minimal correlation identifiers
3. Multi-collection and similarity search capabilities
4. Query performance with realistic datasets
5. Advanced ChromaDB features (health monitoring, duplicate detection)

### Storage Performance and Scale Testing
Tests will validate ChromaDB performance characteristics:
- Storage efficiency with minimal metadata approach
- Query response times with production-size collections
- Memory usage during bulk storage operations
- Collection health and maintenance capabilities

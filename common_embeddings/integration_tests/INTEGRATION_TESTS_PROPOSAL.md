# Integration Tests Proposal - Common Embeddings Module

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive integration testing strategy for the Common Embeddings Module that validates the entire pipeline from data ingestion through correlation and enrichment using real-world data sources. The tests will use actual data from the project's real estate JSON files and Wikipedia SQLite database to ensure the system performs correctly with production-like datasets.

## Testing Philosophy

### Real Data-Driven Testing
Unlike unit tests that use synthetic data, these integration tests leverage the project's actual datasets:
- **220 real estate properties** from San Francisco and Park City
- **11 neighborhoods** with rich demographic and amenity data  
- **557 Wikipedia articles** about Utah and California locations
- **Processed summaries** with confidence scores and location extraction

### End-to-End Validation
Each test validates the complete data flow:
1. Data loading and normalization
2. Text chunking and embedding generation
3. ChromaDB storage with metadata
4. Correlation with source data
5. Entity enrichment and reconstruction

### Performance and Scale Testing
Tests will validate performance characteristics:
- Bulk processing capabilities
- Memory usage with realistic datasets
- Query response times with production-size collections
- Cache effectiveness and hit rates

## Data Source Analysis

### Real Estate Data Structure

**Properties** (220 records across SF/PC):
- **Identifiers**: `listing_id` (e.g., "prop-oak-125", "prop-coal-137")
- **Location Data**: Full addresses, coordinates, neighborhood associations
- **Property Details**: Square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, property type
- **Financial Data**: Listing prices, price per sqft, price history
- **Rich Text**: Descriptions, features lists, amenity details
- **Temporal Data**: Listing dates, days on market

**Neighborhoods** (11 records):
- **Identifiers**: `neighborhood_id` (e.g., "sf-pac-heights-001", "pc-old-town-001")  
- **Geographic**: City, county, state, coordinates
- **Descriptive**: Rich descriptions (200-400 words each)
- **Quantitative**: Walkability scores, transit scores, median prices

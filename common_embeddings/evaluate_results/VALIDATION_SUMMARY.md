# Query Validation Summary Report

## Overall Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 82.5%
- **Total Queries**: 40
- **Total Articles**: 50

## Category Performance

| Category | Queries | Average Accuracy | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Geographic | 8 | 83.3% | 1 problematic query |
| Landmark | 8 | 81.2% | 1 problematic query |
| Historical | 8 | 75.0% | 3 problematic queries |
| Administrative | 8 | 87.5% | 1 problematic query |
| Semantic | 8 | 85.4% | All queries above 50% accuracy |

## Key Findings

### Valid Mappings
Most query-article mappings are accurate and make logical sense:
- Geographic queries correctly identify locations by county, state, and regional features
- Landmark queries properly match parks, mountains, and tourist destinations
- Administrative queries accurately link to counties and municipalities
- Semantic queries successfully identify thematic relationships

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Geographic Mismatches
- **Query**: "Southern Utah locations" 
  - Incorrectly includes Deer Creek State Park (Wasatch County - Northern Utah)
  - Incorrectly includes Cedar Mountains (Tooele County - Northern Utah)
  - **Recommendation**: Update expected results to only include actual Southern Utah counties (Iron, Washington, Kane, Garfield, Beaver)

#### 2. Landmark Classification
- **Query**: "State parks for recreation"
  - Wayne County, Utah is a county, not a state park
  - Bidwell Mansion is a historic park, not primarily recreational
  - **Recommendation**: Focus on articles explicitly about state parks with recreational facilities

#### 3. Historical Context
- **Query**: "California Historical Landmarks"
  - San Francisco Peninsula is geographic, not specifically about historical landmarks
  - **Recommendation**: Limit to articles specifically about historical landmark designations

#### 4. Administrative Scope
- **Query**: "City governments and municipalities"
  - State parks and mountains don't have city governments
  - **Recommendation**: Only include actual cities and towns with municipal governments

## Validation Methodology

The validation checked each query-article pair for:
1. **Keyword matching** in title and summary
2. **Geographic accuracy** (correct state, county, region)
3. **Category relevance** (landmark vs. administrative vs. historical)
4. **Semantic relationships** for thematic queries

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Expected Results**: Remove articles that don't directly match query intent
2. **Add Relevance Scores**: Use graduated relevance (0-3) instead of binary
3. **Expand Query Set**: Add more specific queries to test edge cases
4. **Include Negative Examples**: Explicitly mark articles that should NOT be returned

## Test Accuracy Assessment

Despite some mismatches, the **82.5% accuracy indicates the test dataset is largely valid** for evaluating the embedding system. The issues identified are primarily:
- Edge cases where geographic boundaries are ambiguous
- Overly broad queries that could have multiple interpretations
- Articles with multiple themes where primary focus isn't clear

## Conclusion

The evaluation dataset provides a solid foundation for testing the embedding system with:
- ✅ Diverse query categories
- ✅ Good coverage of Utah and California locations
- ✅ Mix of specific and semantic queries
- ✅ Generally accurate expected results

The identified issues can be addressed in future iterations but do not invalidate the current evaluation results.

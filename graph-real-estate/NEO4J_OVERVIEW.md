## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture Paradigm

The real estate intelligence system represents a cutting-edge **GraphRAG architecture** that fundamentally transforms traditional property search from keyword-based retrieval to semantic, relationship-aware discovery. This architecture combines three complementary data paradigms:

1. **Structured Graph Data**: Traditional property attributes, geographic hierarchies, and explicit relationships
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic representations of property descriptions for natural language understanding
3. **Knowledge Integration**: External knowledge from Wikipedia articles enriching property context

The system follows a **modular, type-safe architecture** built on Pydantic models (see `src/models/property.py:56-298`) that ensures data integrity throughout the entire pipeline. This design enables robust data transformation from raw JSON input through complex graph relationships to semantic search results.

### Core Architectural Principles

**Separation of Concerns**: The codebase demonstrates exemplary modularity with distinct layers:
- **Data Layer** (`src/models/`): Pydantic models ensuring type safety and validation
- **Persistence Layer** (`src/database/`): Neo4j connection management and transaction handling
- **Business Logic** (`src/controllers/graph_builder.py:19-27`): Orchestrates the multi-phase data loading process
- **Loading Layer** (`src/loaders/`): Specialized loaders for different data types (properties, neighborhoods, Wikipedia)
- **Search Layer** (`src/vectors/`): Vector embedding generation and hybrid search algorithms

**Configuration-Driven Design**: The system uses YAML configuration files (`config.yaml:1-59`) to control embedding providers, search weights, and processing parameters, enabling environment-specific tuning without code changes.

**Transaction Management**: Implements sophisticated transaction handling (`src/database/transaction_manager.py`) with automatic retry logic and proper read/write operation separation, ensuring data consistency even during large batch operations.

### Multi-Provider Embedding Strategy

The architecture supports multiple embedding providers through a unified interface:
- **Ollama** (default): Local embeddings with models like `nomic-embed-text` (768 dimensions) providing cost-free operation
- **OpenAI**: Cloud-based embeddings using `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions) for production workloads
- **Google Gemini**: Alternative cloud provider with `models/embedding-001` (768 dimensions)

This provider abstraction allows seamless switching between local development and production environments while maintaining consistent search quality.

## Data Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

### Multi-Phase Loading Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated **6-phase loading process** orchestrated by the `RealEstateGraphBuilder` class (`src/controllers/graph_builder.py:19`). This phased approach ensures proper dependency resolution and enables granular control over the data loading process.

#### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Validation (`src/controllers/graph_builder.py:29-72`)

The initial phase establishes Neo4j connectivity and validates all data sources using Pydantic models. This phase loads property data from JSON files (`real_estate_data/properties_sf.json`, `real_estate_data/properties_pc.json`) and performs comprehensive validation:

- **Connection Testing**: Verifies Neo4j database accessibility and authentication
- **Data Structure Validation**: Uses Pydantic models to ensure data integrity before processing
- **Wikipedia Integration Check**: Validates availability of Wikipedia enhancement data
- **Dependency Verification**: Confirms all required data sources are available and accessible

#### Phase 2: Schema Creation and Constraints (`src/controllers/graph_builder.py:74-100`)

This phase establishes the graph database schema with optimized constraints and indexes:

- **Database Clearing**: Removes existing data to ensure clean state
- **Constraint Creation**: Establishes uniqueness constraints for critical properties (listing_id, neighborhood_id, feature names)
- **Index Creation**: Creates performance indexes on frequently queried properties
- **Geographic Hierarchy Setup**: Establishes the State → County → City → Neighborhood hierarchy

The constraint system ensures referential integrity and prevents duplicate data while the indexing strategy optimizes query performance for the most common access patterns.

#### Phase 3: Geographic Foundation (`src/loaders/geographic_loader.py`)

Builds the geographic hierarchy that serves as the spatial foundation for all property relationships:

- **State Nodes**: Top-level geographic containers
- **County Nodes**: Regional subdivisions within states  
- **City Nodes**: Municipal boundaries with proper county relationships
- **Geographic Relationships**: `IN_COUNTY` and `IN_CITY` relationships establishing proper hierarchy

This foundation enables sophisticated geographic queries and ensures proper spatial organization of all property data.

#### Phase 4: Wikipedia Knowledge Integration (`src/loaders/wikipedia_loader.py`)

Integrates external knowledge from Wikipedia articles to enrich neighborhood context:

- **Wikipedia Article Nodes**: Creates nodes for relevant Wikipedia articles with metadata (page_id, title, summary, confidence scores)
- **Relationship Typing**: Establishes typed relationships (`primary`, `cultural`, `park`, `landmark`, `transit`, `school`) between articles and neighborhoods
- **Confidence Scoring**: Implements confidence metrics (0.0-1.0) to indicate relationship strength
- **Synthetic Detection**: Identifies and flags low-confidence relationships for quality control

This integration transforms static property listings into rich, contextual narratives that enhance property discovery and market understanding.

#### Phase 5: Neighborhood and Lifestyle Modeling (`src/loaders/neighborhood_loader.py`)

Creates sophisticated neighborhood nodes with lifestyle and market characteristics:

- **Lifestyle Tagging**: Assigns lifestyle tags (`tech-friendly`, `outdoor-recreation`, `ski-access`, `urban`) to neighborhoods
- **Market Metrics**: Calculates average prices, property density, and market positioning
- **Proximity Relationships**: Establishes `NEAR` relationships between adjacent neighborhoods
- **Enhancement Integration**: Connects neighborhoods to their Wikipedia knowledge base

#### Phase 6: Property Loading and Feature Modeling (`src/loaders/property_loader.py:16-100`)

The final phase loads individual properties and establishes their rich feature relationships:

- **Property Node Creation**: Creates property nodes with all attributes (price, details, coordinates, descriptions)
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies and creates unique feature nodes across 8 categories (Interior, Kitchen, Outdoor, View, Recreation, Technology, Parking, Other)
- **Relationship Creation**: Establishes `HAS_FEATURE`, `LOCATED_IN`, `TYPE_OF`, and `IN_PRICE_RANGE` relationships
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computes property and neighborhood similarity scores using multiple factors

### Batch Processing and Performance Optimization

The loading system implements sophisticated batch processing (`config.yaml:24-36`) with optimized batch sizes for different entity types:

- **Small Entity Batches**: States (500), neighborhoods (500) for entities with complex relationships
- **Large Entity Batches**: Counties (1000), cities (1000), features (1000) for simpler entities
- **Property Processing**: Optimized batch size (1000) for the most complex entity type

This batching strategy balances memory usage with transaction efficiency, enabling processing of large datasets while maintaining system responsiveness.

## Graph Data Model

### Node Type Architecture

The graph employs a sophisticated **8-node-type architecture** that captures the full complexity of real estate relationships:

#### Core Entity Nodes

**Property Nodes** (`src/models/property.py:56-221`): The central entities containing comprehensive property information:
- **Identity**: `listing_id` (unique identifier), `neighborhood_id` (geographic link)
- **Financial**: `listing_price`, `price_per_sqft` (calculated), `listing_date`
- **Physical**: Embedded `PropertyDetails` with bedrooms, bathrooms, square_feet, year_built, lot_size
- **Spatial**: `Coordinates` with validated latitude/longitude pairs
- **Descriptive**: `description` (for embedding generation), `features` array (categorized attributes)
- **Vector**: `descriptionEmbedding` (768 or 1536 dimensional vectors for semantic search)

The Property model demonstrates advanced Pydantic patterns with automatic nested object transformation (`@model_validator(mode='before')` on line 105) that converts raw JSON dictionaries into type-safe Pydantic models during instantiation.

**Neighborhood Nodes** (`src/models/neighborhood.py`): Geographic containers with lifestyle and market intelligence:
- **Geographic**: Name, city, state affiliations
- **Lifestyle**: Tags like `tech-friendly`, `outdoor-recreation`, `ski-access` for demographic targeting
- **Market**: Average prices, property density, investment potential scores
- **Context**: Wikipedia article count, cultural significance indicators

#### Supporting Entity Nodes

**Feature Nodes** (`src/models/property.py:243-256`): Categorized property attributes with intelligent ID generation:
- **8 Categories**: Interior, Kitchen, Outdoor, View, Recreation, Technology, Parking, Other
- **Automatic ID Generation**: Feature IDs generated from names using field validation
- **Category Organization**: 416+ features systematically organized for analysis

**Geographic Hierarchy Nodes**:
- **City Nodes**: Municipal boundaries with county relationships
- **County Nodes**: Regional subdivisions for market analysis
- **State Nodes**: Top-level geographic organization

**Market Segmentation Nodes**:
- **PriceRange Nodes** (`src/models/property.py:223-240`): Market segmentation (Under $500k, $500k-$1M, $1M-$2M, $2M-$3M, $3M-$5M, $5M+)
- **PropertyType Nodes**: Classification system (single-family, condo, townhouse, multi-family)

**Knowledge Integration Nodes**:
- **WikipediaArticle Nodes**: External knowledge with confidence scoring and relationship typing

### Relationship Architecture

The system implements **12 distinct relationship types** that capture the full spectrum of real estate connections:

#### Core Spatial Relationships

**LOCATED_IN** (Property → Neighborhood): Primary geographic relationship connecting properties to their neighborhoods with potential metadata for proximity scoring.

**IN_CITY** (Neighborhood → City): Municipal boundary relationships enabling city-level market analysis.

**IN_COUNTY** (City → County): Regional organization for broader market intelligence.

**NEAR** (Neighborhood ↔ Neighborhood): Proximity relationships within cities enabling neighborhood-to-neighborhood discovery.

#### Feature and Classification Relationships

**HAS_FEATURE** (Property → Feature): Multi-valued relationships connecting properties to their features, enabling complex feature-based queries and correlation analysis.

**TYPE_OF** (Property → PropertyType): Classification relationships for property type analysis.

**IN_PRICE_RANGE** (Property → PriceRange): Market segmentation relationships for price-based filtering and analysis.

#### Intelligence and Similarity Relationships

**SIMILAR_TO** (Property ↔ Property, Neighborhood ↔ Neighborhood): Calculated similarity relationships with numerical scores (0.0-1.0) based on multiple factors including features, price, location, and market characteristics.

**DESCRIBES** (WikipediaArticle → Neighborhood): Knowledge integration relationships with confidence scores and relationship types (`primary`, `cultural`, `park`, `landmark`, `transit`, `school`).

### Data Model Patterns

#### Type Safety and Validation

The entire data model leverages **Pydantic's validation system** to ensure data integrity:

- **Field Validation**: Range constraints (latitude: -90 to 90, similarity scores: 0.0 to 1.0)
- **Type Conversion**: Automatic string normalization and enum validation
- **Custom Validators**: Complex validation logic for addresses, coordinates, and feature IDs
- **Nested Model Transformation**: Automatic conversion of raw dictionaries to typed models

#### Relationship Metadata

Critical relationships carry metadata for enhanced querying:

- **Similarity Scores**: SIMILAR_TO relationships include numerical similarity metrics
- **Confidence Scores**: Wikipedia DESCRIBES relationships include confidence indicators
- **Relationship Types**: Wikipedia relationships specify their nature (cultural, recreational, etc.)

This metadata enables sophisticated filtering and ranking in complex queries.

- **ACID Compliance**: Vector operations participate in Neo4j transactions
- **Index Optimization**: Native HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for sub-100ms similarity searches
- **Memory Efficiency**: Eliminates data duplication between graph and vector stores

### Vector Index Management (`src/vectors/vector_manager.py:8-100`)

The `PropertyVectorManager` class implements sophisticated vector index management following Neo4j best practices:

#### Index Creation and Configuration

The vector index creation process demonstrates production-ready patterns:

- **Index Existence Checking**: Queries existing indexes before creation to prevent conflicts

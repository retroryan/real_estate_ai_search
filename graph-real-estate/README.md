# Real Estate Graph Builder

A sophisticated graph database application that demonstrates cutting-edge GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques for real estate search and discovery. This system combines Neo4j's powerful graph database capabilities with state-of-the-art vector embeddings from LlamaIndex to create a hybrid search engine that understands both semantic meaning and structural relationships. The modular architecture showcases best practices for building production-ready AI applications with clean separation of concerns, full type safety through Pydantic validation, and support for multiple embedding providers including local (Ollama) and cloud-based (OpenAI, Gemini) models.

## Graph Data Model

The Neo4j graph database uses a rich, interconnected model that captures the complex relationships between properties, neighborhoods, and features:

**Node Types:**
- **Properties**: Core entities representing individual real estate listings with attributes like price, square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and descriptive text
- **Neighborhoods**: Geographic areas with demographic data, lifestyle characteristics, median prices, and walkability scores
- **Features**: Granular property attributes organized into categories (interior, exterior, amenities, location, smart home, sustainability, luxury, views)
- **Cities**: High-level geographic nodes connecting neighborhoods and providing regional context

**Relationship Types:**
- **LOCATED_IN**: Connects properties to their neighborhoods and neighborhoods to their cities
- **HAS_FEATURE**: Links properties to their specific features, enabling feature-based discovery
- **SIMILAR_TO**: Dynamic relationships created based on vector similarity for recommendation systems

**Vector Layer:**
- **Property Embeddings**: High-dimensional vector representations of property descriptions stored directly on property nodes
- **Native Vector Index**: Neo4j's HNSW-based similarity search index for efficient nearest neighbor queries
- **Hybrid Attributes**: Each node contains both structured data (for filtering) and unstructured embeddings (for semantic search)

##  Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start Neo4j** (Docker)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Configure Environment**
Edit `.env` file with your Neo4j credentials

4. **Install Ollama** (for local embeddings)
```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull embedding model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

## Usage

### 1. Build the Graph Database
```bash
# Run complete setup
python main.py all

# Run individual steps
python main.py setup          # Environment setup & data validation
python main.py schema         # Create core graph schema (nodes & properties)
python main.py relationships  # Create graph relationships

# Utilities
python main.py queries        # Run sample queries
python main.py interactive    # Interactive query mode
python main.py stats          # View database statistics
python main.py clear          # Clear all data
```

### 2. Create Vector Embeddings
```bash
# Generate embeddings for all properties
python create_embeddings.py

# Force recreate embeddings
python create_embeddings.py --force-recreate

# Use different embedding model
python create_embeddings.py --model mxbai-embed-large
```

### 3. Search Properties
```bash
# Natural language search
python search_properties.py "modern condo with city views"

# Search with filters
python search_properties.py "family home" --city "San Francisco" --price-max 2000000 --bedrooms-min 3

# Run demo with multiple queries
python search_properties.py --demo

# Disable graph boost (vector similarity only)
python search_properties.py "luxury property" --no-graph-boost
```

## Vector Search Features

### Hybrid Scoring Algorithm
The search combines multiple signals:
- **Vector Similarity (60%)**: Semantic similarity between query and property descriptions
- **Graph Centrality (20%)**: Importance based on graph connections
- **Feature Richness (20%)**: Number and quality of property features

**Note**: These weights (60/20/20) were implemented as a first-pass estimate. Future work should test and optimize these values using data-driven approaches:
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different weight combinations with real users
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** - Weight-free ranking combination
- **Grid Search Optimization** - Systematic parameter tuning
- **Learned Weights** - Machine learning based on relevance feedback
- **Query-Adaptive Weights** - Different weights for different query types
- **Bayesian Optimization** - Efficient hyperparameter search

See `HYBRID_SEARCH.md` for detailed implementation proposals.

### Supported Filters
- `--price-min` / `--price-max`: Price range filtering
- `--city`: Filter by city name
- `--neighborhood`: Filter by neighborhood
- `--bedrooms-min`: Minimum number of bedrooms
- `--bathrooms-min`: Minimum number of bathrooms
- `--sqft-min`: Minimum square footage

### Embedding Providers
Configure in `src/vectors/config.yaml`:
- **Ollama** (default): Local embeddings with nomic-embed-text or mxbai-embed-large
- **OpenAI**: Using text-embedding-3-small or text-embedding-3-large
- **Gemini**: Google's embedding models

##  Sample Queries

After building the graph, you can run queries to explore:
- Properties by city
- Most expensive neighborhoods
- Feature distribution
- Similar properties
- Price ranges
- **Semantic search**: "luxury property with mountain views"
- **Lifestyle queries**: "family-friendly home near schools"
- **Investment queries**: "affordable property with rental potential"

## Architecture

This application follows a **clean, modular architecture** designed for maintainability and growth.

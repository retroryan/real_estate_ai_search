## Graph Data Model

The Neo4j graph database uses a rich, interconnected model that captures the complex relationships between properties, neighborhoods, features, and Wikipedia articles:

**Node Types:**
- **Property**: Enhanced with features array, price_per_sqft, timestamps, and enriched descriptions
- **Neighborhood**: Geographic areas with lifestyle tags, price trends, and enhanced attributes
- **Feature**: Categorized property attributes across 8 categories (Interior, Kitchen, Outdoor, View, Recreation, Technology, Parking, Other)
- **Wikipedia**: Encyclopedia articles with titles, summaries, confidence scores, and relationship types
- **City**: High-level geographic nodes with county relationships
- **County**: Regional organization for geographic hierarchy
- **PriceRange**: Market segmentation nodes for property grouping
- **PropertyType**: Property classification nodes

**Relationship Types:**
- **LOCATED_IN**: Properties to neighborhoods
- **IN_CITY**: Neighborhoods to cities  
- **IN_COUNTY**: Cities to counties
- **HAS_FEATURE**: Properties to their specific features
- **SIMILAR_TO**: Property and neighborhood similarities based on calculated scores
- **NEAR**: Neighborhood proximity relationships within cities
- **IN_PRICE_RANGE**: Properties to price range categories
- **TYPE_OF**: Properties to property types
- **DESCRIBES**: Wikipedia articles to neighborhoods with confidence scores

**Vector Layer:**
- **Property Embeddings**: High-dimensional vector representations of property descriptions stored directly on property nodes
- **Native Vector Index**: Neo4j's HNSW-based similarity search index for efficient nearest neighbor queries
- **Hybrid Attributes**: Each node contains both structured data (for filtering) and unstructured embeddings (for semantic search)

##  Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start Neo4j** (Docker)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Configure Environment**
Edit `.env` file with your Neo4j credentials:
```env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```

4. **Configure Embeddings** (`config.yaml`)
The system supports three embedding providers. Edit `config.yaml` to configure:

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: ollama  # Options: ollama (local), openai, gemini
  
  # For Ollama (default - no API key needed)
  ollama_model: "nomic-embed-text"  # 768 dimensions
  # Alternative: "mxbai-embed-large" (1024 dimensions)
  
  # For OpenAI (requires OPENAI_API_KEY env var)
  openai_model: "text-embedding-3-small"  # 1536 dimensions
  
  # For Gemini (requires GEMINI_API_KEY env var)  
  gemini_model: "models/embedding-001"  # 768 dimensions

search:
  use_graph_boost: true  # Enable hybrid search
  vector_weight: 0.6     # 60% semantic similarity
  graph_weight: 0.2      # 20% graph relationships
  features_weight: 0.2   # 20% property features
```

5. **Install Ollama** (for local embeddings - recommended)
```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull embedding model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**Note**: Ollama provides free, local embeddings with no API limits. OpenAI and Gemini require API keys and have usage costs.

## Usage

### 1. Build the Knowledge Graph Database

The application uses a phased approach to build the knowledge graph:

```bash
# Run complete graph load (all phases) - RECOMMENDED
python main.py load

# Or run individual phases:
python main.py validate       # Phase 1: Validate data sources
python main.py geographic     # Phase 2: Load geographic foundation (States, Counties, Cities)
python main.py wikipedia      # Phase 3: Load Wikipedia knowledge layer
python main.py neighborhoods  # Phase 4: Load neighborhoods with correlations

# Utility commands:
python main.py verify         # Verify graph integrity after loading
python main.py stats          # Show database statistics
python main.py clear          # Clear all data
```

**Note**: The application has been refactored with a modular architecture using Pydantic models for type safety. The old commands (`setup`, `schema`, `relationships`) are deprecated but still recognized for backward compatibility.

### 2. Create Vector Embeddings
```bash
# Generate embeddings using config.yaml settings
python -m src.scripts.create_embeddings

# Force recreate all embeddings (delete existing and regenerate)
python -m src.scripts.create_embeddings --force-recreate
```

**Note**: All embedding settings (provider, model, dimensions) are configured in `config.yaml`. To use a different model like `mxbai-embed-large`, update the `ollama_model` setting in `config.yaml`.

## Vector Search Features

### Hybrid Scoring Algorithm
The search combines multiple signals:
- **Vector Similarity (60%)**: Semantic similarity between query and property descriptions
- **Graph Centrality (20%)**: Importance based on graph connections
- **Feature Richness (20%)**: Number and quality of property features

**Note**: These weights (60/20/20) were implemented as a first-pass estimate. Future work should test and optimize these values using data-driven approaches:
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different weight combinations with real users
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** - Weight-free ranking combination
- **Grid Search Optimization** - Systematic parameter tuning
- **Learned Weights** - Machine learning based on relevance feedback
- **Query-Adaptive Weights** - Different weights for different query types
- **Bayesian Optimization** - Efficient hyperparameter search

See `HYBRID_SEARCH.md` for detailed implementation proposals.

### Supported Filters
- `--price-min` / `--price-max`: Price range filtering
- `--city`: Filter by city name
- `--neighborhood`: Filter by neighborhood
- `--bedrooms-min`: Minimum number of bedrooms
- `--bathrooms-min`: Minimum number of bathrooms
- `--sqft-min`: Minimum square footage

### Embedding Providers
Configure in `src/vectors/config.yaml`:
- **Ollama** (default): Local embeddings with nomic-embed-text or mxbai-embed-large
- **OpenAI**: Using text-embedding-3-small or text-embedding-3-large
- **Gemini**: Google's embedding models

- **100+ Enriched Properties**: Properties with Wikipedia-powered descriptions
- **Multiple Relationship Types**: primary, cultural, park, landmark, transit, school
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each Wikipedia relationship has a confidence score (0.0-1.0)

### Wikipedia Data Model
```cypher
// Wikipedia Node
(w:Wikipedia {
  page_id: INTEGER,        // Wikipedia page ID
  title: STRING,           // Article title
  summary: STRING,         // Short summary (500 chars)
  url: STRING,             // Wikipedia URL (stored but not fetched)
  confidence: FLOAT,       // Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
  is_synthetic: BOOLEAN,   // True if confidence < 0.5
  relationship_type: STRING // Type of relationship to neighborhood
})

// DESCRIBES Relationship
(w:Wikipedia)-[:DESCRIBES {
  confidence: FLOAT,
  discovered_via: STRING
}]->(n:Neighborhood)
```

### Wikipedia Enhancement Process
1. **Data Source**: Wikipedia data from `data/wikipedia/wikipedia.db`
2. **Automatic Import**: During `python main.py all`, Wikipedia articles are imported
3. **Relationship Creation**: Articles linked to neighborhoods based on geographic relevance
4. **Property Enrichment**: Property descriptions enhanced with neighborhood Wikipedia context
5. **URL Storage**: Wikipedia URLs stored for reference (content is in database, not fetched)

### Using Wikipedia Features
```python
# Find properties near cultural landmarks
MATCH (p:Property)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:Neighborhood)<-[:DESCRIBES]-(w:Wikipedia)
WHERE w.relationship_type = 'cultural'
RETURN p, n, w.title

# Get neighborhood Wikipedia context
MATCH (n:Neighborhood {name: 'Pacific Heights'})<-[:DESCRIBES]-(w:Wikipedia)
RETURN w.title, w.relationship_type, w.confidence
ORDER BY w.confidence DESC

# Properties with rich Wikipedia context
MATCH (p:Property)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:Neighborhood)
MATCH (n)<-[:DESCRIBES]-(w:Wikipedia)
WITH p, n, count(w) as wiki_count
WHERE wiki_count > 5
RETURN p, n, wiki_count
```

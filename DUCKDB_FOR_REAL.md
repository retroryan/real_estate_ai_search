 The Real Problem

  Looking at the codebase, the ACTUAL core issue isn't the lack of TableIdentifier objects everywhere -
  it's that:

  1. We're using string concatenation for SQL instead of DuckDB's parameterized queries
  2. We're not using DuckDB's Relation API which provides type safety naturally
  3. We're reinventing the wheel with TableIdentifier when DuckDB already handles this

  What a DuckDB Engineer Would Do

  1. Use DuckDB's Native Table Management

  # Instead of TableIdentifier everywhere
  class DuckDBConnectionManager:
      def table_exists(self, table_name: str) -> bool:
          """Check if table exists using DuckDB's information_schema."""
          result = self.conn.execute(
              """
              SELECT COUNT(*) 
              FROM information_schema.tables 
              WHERE table_name = ? AND table_schema = ?
              """,
              [table_name, "main"]
          ).fetchone()
          return result[0] > 0

      def drop_table(self, table_name: str) -> None:
          """Drop table safely using parameterized query."""
          # DuckDB doesn't support parameterized DDL, so validate first
          if not self._is_valid_table_name(table_name):
              raise ValueError(f"Invalid table name: {table_name}")
          self.conn.execute(f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {table_name}")

      @staticmethod
      def _is_valid_table_name(name: str) -> bool:
          """Validate table name against injection."""
          import re
          return bool(re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,63}$', name))

  2. Use DuckDB's Relation API for Data Operations

  # Instead of string SQL everywhere
  def transform_properties(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection):
      """Transform using DuckDB's relation API."""
      # Get table as relation
      bronze = conn.table("bronze_properties")

      # Transform using method chaining
      silver = (bronze
          .filter("listing_id IS NOT NULL")
          .filter("price > 0")
          .project("""
              listing_id,
              price,
              bedrooms,
              bathrooms,
              square_feet
          """)
      )

      # Create new table from relation
      silver.create("silver_properties")

  3. Use Views for Complex Transformations

  # Instead of complex CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
  def create_gold_view(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection):
      """Create view for gold layer."""
      conn.execute("""
          CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW gold_properties AS
          SELECT 
              p.*,
              n.neighborhood_name,
              n.median_income
          FROM silver_properties p
          LEFT JOIN silver_neighborhoods n 
              ON p.neighborhood_id = n.neighborhood_id
      """)

  4. Use DuckDB's Native Parquet Integration

  # Instead of custom parquet writer
  def export_to_parquet(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection, table_name: str):
      """Export using DuckDB's native parquet support."""
      conn.execute(f"""
          COPY (SELECT * FROM {table_name}) 
          TO 'output/{table_name}.parquet' 
          (FORMAT PARQUET)
      """)

  The Better Solution

  Instead of migrating everything to TableIdentifier, we should:

  1. Keep table names as simple strings with validation at boundaries
  2. Use parameterized queries where DuckDB supports them
  3. Use DuckDB's Relation API for data transformations
  4. Validate table names once at entry points, not everywhere
  5. Use DuckDB's native features instead of wrapping everything

  Recommended Approach

  class PipelineTableNames:
      """Central registry of table names - validated once."""
      BRONZE_PROPERTIES = "bronze_properties"
      SILVER_PROPERTIES = "silver_properties"
      GOLD_PROPERTIES = "gold_properties"

      @classmethod
      def validate_all(cls):
          """Validate all table names at startup."""
          pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,63}$')
          for name in cls.__dict__.values():
              if isinstance(name, str) and not pattern.match(name):
                  raise ValueError(f"Invalid table name: {name}")

  # Then use directly
  conn.table(PipelineTableNames.BRONZE_PROPERTIES)

  Conclusion

  The current TableIdentifier approach is over-engineering for DuckDB. A DuckDB engineer would:

  1. Use simple string table names with validation at boundaries
  2. Leverage DuckDB's Relation API for type-safe operations
  3. Use parameterized queries where possible
  4. Let DuckDB handle the SQL generation through its APIs

  The extensive TableIdentifier migration is actually moving AWAY from DuckDB best practices, not towards
  them. We should consider reverting the TableIdentifier changes and instead focus on using DuckDB's native
   features properly.

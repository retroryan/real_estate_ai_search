# Pipeline Changes Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Fixed Core Issues ✅
- **Added enriched_description field** to Gold property layer
  - Combines property description with Wikipedia context from neighborhood
  - Located in: `squack_pipeline_v2/gold/property.py`

- **Feature nodes and HAS_FEATURE relationships** 
  - Fixed feature_id field generation in `squack_pipeline_v2/gold/graph_builder.py`
  - Feature nodes extracted from properties with proper IDs
  - HAS_FEATURE relationships connect properties to features

- **Field naming consistency**
  - Renamed `school_score` to `school_rating` throughout pipeline
  - Updated in: Gold layer, Graph builder, ES writer
  - Maintains consistency with graph_real_estate expectations

### 2. Cleanup and Validation ✅
- **Removed unused Pydantic models**
  - Deleted `/models/raw`, `/models/standardized`, `/models/enriched` directories
  - Pipeline uses DuckDB directly, not Pydantic models
  - Only `/models/pipeline` metrics models are retained and used

- **Updated tests**
  - Fixed `test_gold_property_enrichment` to expect new enrichments
  - Fixed `test_medallion_architecture` to validate correct fields
  - Fixed `test_bronze_wikipedia_ingestion` to accept page_summaries join

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENTS EXACTLY!!! Do not add new features or functionality beyond the specific requirements requested and documented.
* ALWAYS FIX THE CORE ISSUE!
* COMPLETE CHANGE: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION: Simple, direct replacements only
* NO MIGRATION PHASES: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO ROLLBACK PLANS!! Never create rollback plans.
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES: Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS or Backwards Compatibility: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED and change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC
* USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE!
* Never name things after the phases or steps of the proposal and process documents. So never test_phase_2_bronze_layer.py etc.
* if hasattr should never be used. And never use isinstance
* Never cast variables or cast variable names or add variable aliases
* If you are using a union type something is wrong. Go back and evaluate the core issue of why you need a union
* If it doesn't work don't hack and mock. Fix the core issue
* If there is questions please ask me!!!
* Do not generate mocks or sample data if the actual results are missing. Find out why the data is missing and if still not found ask.

## Executive Summary

Following the successful refactoring of demos 1-10, demos 11-15 require the same systematic refactoring to align with the new architecture. These demos currently exhibit significant code quality issues including code duplication, inconsistent patterns, missing base class utilization, and violation of single responsibility principles. This proposal addresses these issues by applying the same proven patterns used in demos 1-10.

## Current State Analysis

### Demo 11: Natural Language Semantic Search
- **Location**: `semantic/demo_runner.py::demo_natural_language_search`
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Direct instantiation of services without base class usage
  - Manual error handling instead of using BaseDemoRunner patterns
  - Embedding service lifecycle management inline with search logic
  - Complex error result creation not using standardized patterns
  - No entity-specific demo base class (should have SemanticDemoBase)

### Demo 12: Natural Language Examples
- **Location**: `semantic/demo_runner.py::demo_natural_language_examples`
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Complex loop logic with mixed concerns (embedding + search + result collection)
  - Manual aggregation of results across multiple queries
  - Inconsistent error handling with partial failures
  - Display comments scattered throughout business logic
  - No use of base class execution patterns

### Demo 13: Semantic vs Keyword Comparison
- **Location**: `semantic/demo_runner.py::demo_semantic_vs_keyword_comparison`
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Long function (likely over 100 lines based on pattern)
  - Comparison logic mixed with search execution
  - Display logic embedded in data processing
  - No clear separation between semantic and keyword search flows
  - Missing dedicated comparison result model

### Demo 14: Rich Property Listing (Single Query Relationships)
- **Location**: `demo_single_query_relationships.py`
- **Issues Identified**:
  - SimplifiedRelationshipDemo class not extending any base class
  - Manual time tracking and error handling
  - Direct Elasticsearch client usage without abstraction
  - Mixed entity result processing in single method
  - No integration with PropertyRelationshipsQueryBuilder pattern

### Demo 15: Hybrid Search
- **Location**: `hybrid_search.py::demo_hybrid_search`
- **Issues Identified**:
  - HybridSearchEngine instantiation inline
  - Manual result conversion from SearchResult to PropertySearchResult
  - No base class utilization
  - Direct exception handling without standardized patterns
  - Missing HybridDemoBase for hybrid search patterns

## Identified Patterns from Demos 1-10

Based on the successful refactoring of demos 1-10, the following patterns have been established:

### 1. Entity-Specific Base Classes
Each entity type has its own demo base class that extends BaseDemoRunner:
- PropertyDemoBase for property searches
- AggregationDemoBase for aggregation queries  
- WikipediaDemoBase for Wikipedia searches
- (Missing: SemanticDemoBase, HybridDemoBase, RelationshipDemoBase)

### 2. Standardized Execution Pattern
All demos follow the execute_demo pattern from BaseDemoRunner:
- Query building via dedicated query builder
- Search execution with standardized error handling
- Result processing via entity-specific processors
- Error result creation through base class methods

### 3. Clean Separation of Concerns
- Query builders handle query DSL creation only
- Demo runners orchestrate the flow
- Result models handle their own display
- Base classes handle common patterns

### 4. Configuration-Driven Defaults
All default values come from centralized demo_config:
- No hard-coded values in demo functions
- Consistent default handling across all demos
- Type-safe configuration with Pydantic models

### 5. Result Model Self-Display
Each result type contains its own display logic:
- PropertySearchResult.display()
- AggregationSearchResult.display()
- MixedEntityResult.display()
- No separate display service classes

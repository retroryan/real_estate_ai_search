# Real Estate Knowledge Graph Model Fix Implementation Plan

## Overall Status: 85% Complete (Phase 1 and 2 of 3 Completed)

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only  
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC**: All models and data structures use Pydantic validation
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE**: Maintain clean, modular architecture

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the gaps identified in REALLY_FIX_MODEL.md to bring the Data Pipeline implementation to complete parity with the conceptual model while leveraging its Spark-based architecture. The implementation will be executed in three distinct phases: adding missing nodes, adding missing properties, and establishing missing relationships. Each phase represents a complete, atomic change that transforms the entire system without maintaining compatibility layers.

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the implementation of comprehensive tool discovery capabilities for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) client-server architecture in the real estate search system. The primary goal is to enable the client to dynamically discover, understand, and log all available tools from the MCP server, providing full transparency of server capabilities.

## Core Problem Statement

The current MCP client implementation lacks comprehensive tool discovery capabilities. While a basic `list_tools()` method exists, it only returns tool names without providing:
- Tool descriptions and purpose
- Parameter schemas and requirements
- Return type specifications
- Tool categorization and organization
- Comprehensive logging of discovered capabilities
- Validation of tool availability and health

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive tool discovery system that:

1. **Discovers all available tools** from the MCP server on client initialization
2. **Extracts complete tool metadata** including descriptions, parameters, and return types
3. **Validates tool schemas** using Pydantic models for type safety
4. **Logs discovered capabilities** in a structured, readable format
5. **Provides tool introspection** methods for runtime capability queries
6. **Demonstrates discovery** through a dedicated demo showing all discovered tools

## Functional Requirements

### Tool Discovery Requirements

The system must automatically discover and catalog all available MCP tools when the client connects to the server. This discovery process must retrieve:
- Tool names and unique identifiers
- Human-readable descriptions
- Complete parameter schemas with types and constraints
- Return value specifications
- Tool categories or groupings
- Version information if available

### Tool Metadata Requirements

Each discovered tool must have complete metadata including:
- A clear description of what the tool does
- Required and optional parameters with their types
- Default values for optional parameters
- Validation rules and constraints
- Expected return value structure
- Error conditions and handling requirements

### Logging Requirements

The discovery process must log:
- Total number of tools discovered
- Each tool's name and description
- Parameter requirements for each tool
- Any tools that failed discovery or validation
- Server capabilities summary
- Discovery timestamp and duration

### Validation Requirements

All discovered tools must be validated:
- Parameter schemas must be valid Pydantic models
- Required fields must be properly marked
- Types must be Python-compatible
- Return types must be parseable
- Tool names must be unique

### Demonstration Requirements

A dedicated demo must:
- Connect to the MCP server
- Discover all available tools
- Display discovered tools in a formatted table
- Show parameter schemas for each tool
- Log the complete discovery process
- Validate that all expected tools are available

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- Tool discovery must complete within 5 seconds
- Discovery results must be cached for subsequent queries
- Lazy loading of detailed schemas when needed
- Minimal memory footprint for tool metadata storage

### Reliability Requirements

- Discovery must handle partial server responses gracefully
- Failed tool discovery must not block client initialization
- Retry logic for transient discovery failures
- Clear error messages for discovery problems

### Maintainability Requirements

- Clean separation of discovery logic from client operations
- Pydantic models for all data structures
- No dynamic type generation or runtime modifications
- Clear module boundaries and responsibilities

### Usability Requirements

- Simple API for tool discovery and introspection
- Human-readable discovery logs
- Structured output formats for tool information
- Integration with existing client patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Discovery Flow

The tool discovery process follows a clear, linear flow:

1. Client establishes connection to MCP server
2. Client requests tool list from server
3. Server responds with complete tool manifest
4. Client parses and validates tool metadata
5. Client stores tool information in Pydantic models
6. Client logs discovered capabilities
7. Client marks discovery as complete

### Data Models

All tool metadata is stored in strict Pydantic models:

- **ToolParameter**: Represents a single tool parameter with name, type, description, and constraints
- **ToolSchema**: Complete schema for a tool including all parameters and return type
- **DiscoveredTool**: Full tool representation with name, description, schema, and metadata
- **ToolCatalog**: Collection of all discovered tools with lookup and query methods

### Module Structure

The implementation follows clean module boundaries:

- **discovery**: Core discovery logic and orchestration
- **models**: Pydantic models for tool metadata
- **logging**: Structured logging for discovery process
- **validation**: Schema validation and type checking
- **demo**: Demonstration of discovery capabilities

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

2. **Full Metadata**: Each tool has complete parameter and return type information
3. **Structured Logging**: Discovery process logs all tools in readable format
4. **Type Safety**: All tool metadata uses validated Pydantic models
5. **Demo Functionality**: Demo successfully shows all discovered tools
6. **No Hacks**: Implementation uses clean code without workarounds
7. **Performance**: Discovery completes in under 5 seconds
8. **Reliability**: Discovery handles errors gracefully

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Incomplete Server Metadata**: Server may not provide full tool information
  - Mitigation: Define minimum required metadata and fail gracefully for missing data
  
- **Schema Incompatibility**: Server schemas may not map to Pydantic models
  - Mitigation: Create flexible parsing that handles various schema formats
  
- **Performance Impact**: Discovery may slow client initialization
  - Mitigation: Implement async discovery with caching

### Implementation Risks

- **Breaking Changes**: Discovery may break existing client functionality
  - Mitigation: Implement as addition to existing code, not replacement
  
- **Complex Dependencies**: Discovery may require new dependencies
  - Mitigation: Use only existing FastMCP and Pydantic capabilities

## Conclusion

This proposal provides a comprehensive approach to implementing tool discovery in the MCP client-server architecture. By following the strict implementation requirements and avoiding common anti-patterns, the solution will provide robust, maintainable tool discovery that enhances the client's ability to understand and utilize server capabilities. The phased implementation plan ensures systematic development with clear validation at each stage, culminating in a fully functional discovery system with comprehensive demonstration capabilities.

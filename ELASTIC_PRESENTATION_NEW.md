```python
# Example from squack_pipeline_v2/writers/elastic/base.py
actions = []
for record in batch_data:  # Process batch of 100 documents
    document = transform(record)  # Pydantic validation
    doc = document.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
    action = {
        "_index": index_name,
        "_id": doc[id_field],
        "_source": doc
    }
    actions.append(action)

# Bulk index entire batch
result = bulk(es_client, actions, raise_on_error=False)
```

*Summary: Efficient bulk indexing pipeline streams millions of documents from DuckDB to Elasticsearch with validation, error handling, and performance monitoring*

## Slide 8: Text Search (BM25)
**Traditional Keyword Matching with Field Boosting**

Elasticsearch's BM25 algorithm provides powerful text relevance scoring, enabling precise keyword matching across multiple fields with configurable importance weights.

```python
{
    "multi_match": {
        "query": query_text,
        "fields": [
            "description^2.0",
            "features^1.5",
            "address.city"
        ]
    }
}
```

*Key Features:*

Nearest neighbor search enables semantic understanding, finding properties based on meaning rather than exact keywords, powered by 1024-dimensional embeddings.

```python
{
    "knn": {
        "field": "embedding_vector",
        "query_vector": query_embedding,
        "k": 10,
        "num_candidates": 100
    }
}
```

*Capabilities:*

---

## Slide 11: Hybrid Search (RRF)
**Combining Text and Vector for Optimal Results**

Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges keyword precision with semantic understanding, delivering superior search results by leveraging both BM25 and vector similarities.

```python
{
    "retriever": {
        "rrf": {
            "retrievers": [
                {
                    "standard": {
                        "query": text_query
                    }
                },
                {
                    "knn": vector_config
                }
            ],
            "rank_constant": 60  # Controls ranking fusion behavior
        }
    }
}
```

*RRF Algorithm & Parameters:*
- **rank_constant (k):** Controls how much to favor top-ranked results (default 60)
  - Higher k (100+): More even distribution of scores, less bias toward top results
  - Lower k (20-40): Heavily favors top-ranked items from each retriever
  - Formula: score = 1/(k + rank_position)
- **How it works:** Each retriever produces ranked results, RRF combines using reciprocal rank formula, final score is sum of individual RRF scores
- Native Elasticsearch 8.16+ implementation for performance

```python
# DSPy LocationExtractionSignature fields:
class LocationExtractionSignature(dspy.Signature):
    query_text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Natural language search query")
    city: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted city or 'unknown'")
    state: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted state or 'unknown'")
    neighborhood: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extracted neighborhood")
    has_location: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="True if location found")
    cleaned_query: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Query with location removed")
    confidence: float = dspy.OutputField(desc="Extraction confidence 0-1")

# Example: "Modern kitchen in San Francisco near parks"
# Extracts: city="San Francisco", cleaned_query="Modern kitchen near parks"
{
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
                "match": {
                    "address.city": "San Francisco"
                }
            },
            {
                "multi_match": {
                    "query": "Modern kitchen near parks"
                }

# During indexing: Calculate cosine similarity between property embeddings
# Store top-10 similar properties for each listing
{
    "query": {
        "terms": {
            "listing_id": similar_property_ids  # Pre-computed during indexing
        }
    }
}

# Relationship calculation process:
# 1. Load all property embeddings from Elasticsearch
# 2. For each property, calculate cosine_similarity with all others
# 3. Store top-10 most similar (similarity > 0.8 threshold)
# 4. Index in property_relationships index for instant retrieval
```

*Pre-computation Details:*
- **Similarity metric:** Cosine similarity on 1024-dim embeddings
- **Computation time:** One-time batch process during index build
- **Storage:** Denormalized in property_relationships index

---

## Slide 23: RRF Hybrid Architecture
**Modern Retriever Pattern (8.16+)**

Elasticsearch's retriever framework provides clean abstraction for hybrid search, with native RRF implementation for production-grade fusion.

```python
{"retriever": {"rrf": {
    "rank_constant": 60,      # k parameter in RRF formula
    "rank_window_size": 100   # How many results to consider from each retriever
}}}
# RRF Score = Σ(1/(k + rank_i)) for each retriever i
```

*Detailed Parameter Explanation:*
- **rank_constant (k=60):** Core RRF parameter controlling score distribution
  - Formula: score = 1/(60 + rank_position)
  - Rank 1: score = 1/61 = 0.0164
  - Rank 10: score = 1/70 = 0.0143
  - Rank 100: score = 1/160 = 0.0063
- **rank_window_size=100:** Number of top results from each retriever to consider
  - Only top 100 from text search and top 100 from vector search are merged
  - Results beyond position 100 are ignored (even if highly relevant)
  - Larger windows = more comprehensive but slower
- **Fusion process:** Each retriever runs independently in parallel, results are collected and assigned RRF scores, final ranking is sum of RRF scores from all retrievers
- **Performance:** Native C++ implementation, typically adds <10ms overhead

---

## Slide 24: Geo-Shape Queries
**Complex Geographic Boundaries**

# Neo4j Integration Implementation Plan

## Core Principles

This is a **high-quality demo**, not a production system. The implementation must be:
- **CLEAN**: Simple, direct code with no unnecessary abstractions
- **COMPLETE**: Atomic updates only - change everything or change nothing  
- **SIMPLE**: No performance optimizations, caching, or tuning
- **DIRECT**: No wrapper functions, compatibility layers, or migration phases
- **FOCUSED**: Replace the graph-real-estate/ data ingestion entirely

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Update the actual methods directly

## Environment Setup

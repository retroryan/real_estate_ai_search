# MCP Tool Description Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Improved MCP tool descriptions to help agents correctly select tools and parameters for Wikipedia searches, following FastMCP best practices.

## Problem Addressed

Agents were incorrectly calling `search_wikipedia` with `None` values for optional parameters when searching for specific locations like "Temescal neighborhood in Oakland", causing validation errors.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Tool Descriptions with Clear Guidance

#### `search_wikipedia` Tool
- **Purpose**: General Wikipedia searches without specific city/location
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added "REQUIRED" and "OPTIONAL" labels for all parameters
  - Included guidance: "Use for general searches when you DON'T have a specific city"
  - Added warning to use `search_wikipedia_by_location` for location-specific searches
  - Provided clear examples of appropriate queries

#### `search_wikipedia_by_location` Tool  
- **Purpose**: Location-specific searches when city/neighborhood is known
- **Key Changes**:
  - Marked as "PREFERRED TOOL for location-based searches"
  - Clear "USE THIS TOOL WHEN" guidance
  - Emphasized that `city` parameter is REQUIRED
  - Examples specifically for neighborhoods like "Temescal"

### 2. FastMCP Best Practices Implementation

All tools now follow FastMCP best practices with:

```python
@app.tool(
    name="tool_name",           # Explicit tool name
    description="...",          # Clear, concise description
    tags={"tag1", "tag2"},     # Categorization tags
    meta={"version": "1.0"}    # Metadata
)
```

### 3. Improved Parameter Documentation

Before:
```
Args:
    city: Filter by city name
    state: Filter by state (2-letter code)
```

After:
```
Args:
    city: REQUIRED - City or neighborhood name (e.g., "Oakland", "Temescal")
    state: OPTIONAL - State code for disambiguation (e.g., "CA", "NY")
```

## Expected Results

1. **Correct Tool Selection**: Agents will choose `search_wikipedia_by_location` for queries like "Temescal neighborhood in Oakland"
2. **No Validation Errors**: Required parameters will always be provided
3. **Better Parameter Usage**: Optional parameters only used when needed
4. **Clearer Intent**: Tool purposes are explicitly differentiated

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
python test_mcp_descriptions.py
```

## Files Modified

1. `/real_estate_search/mcp_server/main.py` - Updated all tool registrations
2. `/real_estate_search/mcp_server/tools/wikipedia_tools.py` - Enhanced docstrings
3. `/test_mcp_descriptions.py` - Created test verification script

## Example Query Resolution

**Query**: "Tell me about the Temescal neighborhood in Oakland - what amenities and culture does it offer?"

**Before**: Agent incorrectly chose `search_wikipedia` with None parameters â†’ Validation Error

**After**: Agent will correctly choose `search_wikipedia_by_location` with:
- `city="Oakland"` 
- `query="Temescal neighborhood amenities culture"`

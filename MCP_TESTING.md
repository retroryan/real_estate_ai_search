Getting Started with MCP Server TestingThis guide provides a basic introduction to the best practices for testing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Testing is essential to ensure your server is reliable, secure, and genuinely useful for Large Language Models (LLMs).We'll cover two main types of testing: Technical Testing (Does the code work as expected?) and Behavioral Testing (Can an LLM understand and use it?).1. Best Practices for Technical TestingTechnical testing focuses on verifying the correctness of your server's code. The goal is to catch bugs, handle errors, and ensure your tools are predictable.Key Practice: Use Standard Frameworks to Test Your ToolsYou don't need special tools to start. Standard testing libraries like pytest for Python or Jest for TypeScript are perfect for the job. You can test your tool's logic directly.Simple Code Example (Python)Let's imagine you have a very simple MCP server that just adds two numbers.server.py# requires: pip install fastmcp
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="CalculatorServer")

@mcp.tool()
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers together and returns the result."""
    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        raise TypeError("Both 'a' and 'b' must be integers.")
    return a + b
Now, let's write a test for the add_numbers tool using pytest.test_server.py# requires: pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
import pytest
from server import mcp
from mcp.types import TextContent
from fastmcp import Client

# Test the happy path
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_add_numbers_successfully():
    """Tests that the tool adds two numbers correctly."""
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool(
            "add_numbers",
            arguments={"a": 5, "b": 10}
        )
        # The result is wrapped in a content type, so we check the text property
        assert isinstance(result[0], TextContent)
        assert result[0].text == '15'

# Test an edge case (error handling)
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_add_numbers_invalid_input():
    """Tests that the tool raises an error with non-integer input."""
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        with pytest.raises(Exception) as e:
            await client.call_tool(
                "add_numbers",
                arguments={"a": 5, "b": "ten"}
            )
        # Check that the error message is helpful
        assert "must be integers" in str(e.value)

This example demonstrates testing the core logic ("happy path") and the error-handling capabilities of your tool, which are fundamental parts of technical testing.2. Best Practices for Behavioral TestingBehavioral testing is about ensuring an LLM can actually understand and use your server effectively. Your server might be technically perfect, but if the LLM can't figure out what your tools are for, it's not useful.Key Practice: Write Clear, Descriptive Tool DocumentationThe tool's name and description are the only things an LLM sees. They must be unambiguous and clear.Bad Description:Tool Name: calculateDescription: Runs a calculation. (Too vague. What kind of calculation?)Good Description:Tool Name: add_numbersDescription: Adds two integer numbers together and returns the sum. Use this for mathematical addition. (Clear, specific, and provides context on when to use it).Key Practice: Use the MCP Inspector for Manual TestingThe MCP Inspector is a visual tool that lets you interact with your server like an LLM would. It's the best way to get a feel for how your server behaves.How to get started:Install the Inspector:npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
Run the Inspector against your server:npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python server.py
This command will start your Python server and open a web interface. In the UI, you can see your add_numbers tool, provide arguments for a and b, and execute the tool to see the result live. This is an excellent way to manually test how your tool responds before you even connect it to an LLM.3. Where to Find More InformationThis guide is just the beginning.

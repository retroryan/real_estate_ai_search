# Production Data Pipeline Workflow Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

This document clarifies the complete production data pipeline workflow, which simulates a real-world enterprise data ingestion and search system. The architecture maintains a clean separation of concerns between index management, data ingestion, and search functionality.

### Architectural Components

**real_estate_search/**: Owns all Elasticsearch interaction, index management, search functionality, and API layers. This module acts as both the setup orchestrator and the search service provider.

**data_pipeline/**: Exclusively handles high-volume data processing through Apache Spark, focusing solely on data transformation and bulk loading into pre-configured Elasticsearch indices.

### Production Workflow Sequence

The system operates in a strict four-phase workflow that ensures data integrity and optimal search performance:

## Phase 1: Pre-Ingestion Index Setup (Owner: real_estate_search/)

### Purpose
Establish all Elasticsearch infrastructure before any data flows through the system. This phase ensures indices are properly configured for optimal search performance and data integrity.

### Execution
A dedicated setup script in `real_estate_search/` performs all pre-ingestion configuration. This script acts as the infrastructure orchestrator, preparing Elasticsearch for incoming data.

### Requirements

**Index Template Creation**
- The setup script must register all index templates with Elasticsearch before pipeline execution
- Templates must include complete field mappings matching expected document structure
- Component templates should define reusable settings for consistency across indices
- Templates must specify custom analyzers for text search optimization
- Priority values must exceed 500 to override system defaults

**Mapping Configuration**
- All field types must be explicitly defined (no reliance on dynamic mapping)
- Text fields must specify appropriate analyzers for language processing
- Numeric fields must use optimal types for aggregation performance
- Geographic fields must be configured as geo_point types
- Nested structures must be properly defined for complex queries
- Multi-fields must be configured for fields requiring different search strategies

**Index Creation**
- Indices must be created from templates before data ingestion
- Primary shard counts must be set based on data volume projections
- Replica settings must ensure high availability requirements
- Refresh intervals must balance search latency with indexing performance
- Index aliases must be established for zero-downtime operations

**Wikipedia Enrichment Field Structure**
- Location context fields for geographic enrichment
- Neighborhood context fields for area information
- Points of interest nested structures
- Landmark arrays with proper nested mapping
- Confidence scoring fields for data quality
- Topic extraction fields for content categorization

**Validation Requirements**
- Script must verify template registration success
- Index creation must be confirmed before proceeding
- Mapping compatibility must be validated
- Connection to Elasticsearch must be tested
- Error conditions must halt setup with clear messages

### Deliverables
- All indices created with proper mappings
- Templates registered and validated
- Aliases configured for production use
- Setup confirmation report generated
- Ready signal for pipeline execution

## Phase 2: Data Pipeline Execution (Owner: data_pipeline/)

### Purpose
Process and transform raw data at scale using Apache Spark, then bulk load the processed documents into the pre-configured Elasticsearch indices.

### Execution
The Spark-based pipeline runs as a batch job, reading source data, applying transformations, and writing to Elasticsearch.

### Requirements

**Pre-Execution Validation**
- Pipeline must verify index existence before processing

- Apply business logic transformations
- Perform data quality checks and cleansing
- Execute Wikipedia enrichment joins
- Generate search-optimized text fields
- Calculate derived fields and metrics

**Document Transformation**
- Transform Spark DataFrames to Elasticsearch document structure
- Map field names to match index mappings exactly
- Build nested structures for complex objects
- Generate document IDs for deduplication
- Add metadata fields (timestamps, versions)
- Ensure all required fields are populated

**Bulk Loading**
- Use Spark's Elasticsearch connector for efficient bulk operations
- Respect Elasticsearch bulk size limits
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Track indexing success and failure counts
- Log rejected documents for investigation
- Maintain indexing rate within cluster capacity

**Error Handling**
- Checkpoint progress for restart capability
- Isolate bad records without stopping pipeline
- Generate detailed error reports

- Provide rollback capability if critical errors occur

### Deliverables
- All documents indexed to Elasticsearch
- Processing statistics and metrics
- Error report with failed documents
- Performance metrics (documents/second, total time)
- Success confirmation for next phase

## Phase 3: Post-Ingestion Validation (Owner: real_estate_search/)

### Purpose
Verify that ingested data is correctly indexed and searchable, ensuring the pipeline output meets all search requirements.

### Execution
A validation script in `real_estate_search/` runs comprehensive tests against the newly indexed data.

### Requirements

**Index Validation**
- Verify document counts match expected values

# Wikipedia Correlation Data Pipeline Enhancement for Elasticsearch

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements
* **COMPLETE CHANGE**: All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED**: Change the actual methods
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC**: All models must use Pydantic for validation
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE**: Maintain clean module structure
* **NO HASATTR**: Never use hasattr for checking fields
* **FIX CORE ISSUES**: If it doesn't work don't hack and mock. Fix the core issue

## Key Goal
Enable high-quality Elasticsearch demo showing enriched neighborhood and property listings with Wikipedia correlation data for improved search functionality.

## Executive Summary
The neighborhood source JSON files contain `wikipedia_correlations` data that is currently discarded during pipeline processing. This includes Wikipedia page IDs, confidence scores, and relationship types that enable enriched search results. This proposal focuses exclusively on preserving and indexing this data in Elasticsearch for a high-quality demo.

## Phase 1: Data Model Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
The current data models in `data_pipeline/models/` lack structures for Wikipedia correlation data found in the neighborhood source JSON.

### Solution Implemented
Created new Pydantic models in `data_pipeline/models/spark_models.py`:

1. **WikipediaArticleReference** - Wikipedia article with page_id, title, url, confidence, and optional relationship
2. **WikipediaGeoReference** - Simple reference for geographic entities  
3. **ParentGeography** - Container for city_wiki and state_wiki references
4. **WikipediaCorrelations** - Main container with primary article, related articles, and parent geography
5. **Updated Neighborhood** - Added wikipedia_correlations field
6. **Updated FlattenedNeighborhood** - Added denormalized fields and full correlations

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created WikipediaArticleReference model with page_id (int), title (str), url (str), confidence (float)
- [x] Added optional relationship field to WikipediaArticleReference for categorization
- [x] Created ParentGeography model with city_wiki and state_wiki sub-objects
- [x] Created WikipediaCorrelations model containing primary_wiki_article, related_wiki_articles list, parent_geography
- [x] Added wikipedia_correlations field to Neighborhood SparkModel
- [x] Updated FlattenedNeighborhood to include primary_wikipedia_page_id, primary_wikipedia_title, primary_wikipedia_confidence
- [x] Updated model exports in __init__.py

## Phase 2: Data Loading ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
The `neighborhood_loader.py` excludes wikipedia_correlations during data transformation.

### Solution Implemented
Updated `data_pipeline/loaders/neighborhood_loader.py` to:

1. Import WikipediaCorrelations model
2. Preserve graph_metadata by renaming to wikipedia_correlations
3. Handle missing correlations with null-safe logic
4. Keep demographics as nested structure (not flattened)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Imported WikipediaCorrelations model in neighborhood_loader.py
- [x] Updated _transform_to_entity_schema to rename graph_metadata to wikipedia_correlations
- [x] Added null-safe handling for missing correlations
- [x] Preserved full neighborhood structure including nested demographics
- [x] Verified correlations preserved in resulting DataFrame

## Phase 3: Data Enrichment ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
The `neighborhood_enricher.py` doesn't preserve wikipedia_correlations during enrichment transformations.

### Solution Implemented
Updated `data_pipeline/enrichment/neighborhood_enricher.py` to:

1. Added _preserve_wikipedia_correlations method to maintain field through transformations
2. Calculate wikipedia_confidence_avg from primary article confidence
3. Include Wikipedia confidence in quality score calculation (15% weight)
4. Null-safe handling for missing correlations

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated enrich method to preserve wikipedia_correlations column
- [x] Added _preserve_wikipedia_correlations method to ensure field carries through
- [x] Calculated average confidence score from primary Wikipedia article
- [x] Included Wikipedia confidence in overall quality_score calculation (15% weight)
- [x] Handled null wikipedia_correlations without errors

## Phase 4: Elasticsearch Writer Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
The Elasticsearch writer and transformations don't handle nested wikipedia_correlations structures.

### Solution Implemented
Updated Elasticsearch components to handle wikipedia_correlations:

1. **DataFrameTransformer** already handles complex nested structures correctly
2. **neighborhoods.json mapping template** updated with complete nested structure:
   - primary_wiki_article as object with page_id, title, url, confidence
   - related_wiki_articles as nested array
   - parent_geography with city_wiki and state_wiki references
   - wikipedia_confidence_avg field for aggregated confidence

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Verified DataFrameTransformer preserves wikipedia_correlations field (no excluded_fields set)
- [x] Confirmed complex nested structure handling in transformer
- [x] Updated neighborhoods.json mapping template with nested wikipedia_correlations structure
- [x] Defined primary_wiki_article as object type with all fields
- [x] Defined related_wiki_articles as nested array type
- [x] Added confidence as float, relationship as keyword, page_id as long
- [x] Added wikipedia_confidence_avg field for enrichment metric

## Phase 5: Search Query Enhancement

### Problem
Current queries don't utilize Wikipedia correlation data for enriched search results.

### Current State Analysis
- Search queries use basic neighborhood fields only
- No correlation-based filtering or boosting
- Missing Wikipedia context in property search results

### Requirements
- Enable Wikipedia-aware neighborhood search
- Add confidence-based relevance boosting
- Include Wikipedia context in property results

### Solution
Create enhanced query capabilities in search services:

1. Filter neighborhoods by Wikipedia confidence
2. Search by relationship types
3. Boost by correlation confidence
4. Join property searches with Wikipedia data

### Todo List
- [ ] Create query for high-confidence Wikipedia neighborhoods (confidence > 0.8)
- [ ] Add filter for specific relationship types (park, landmark, reference)
- [ ] Implement function_score query with confidence boosting
- [ ] Add Wikipedia title to property search results
- [ ] Create compound query joining properties with neighborhood Wikipedia data
- [ ] Document new query patterns and examples
- [ ] Code review and testing

## Implementation Impact Summary

### Benefits for Elasticsearch Demo
- **Rich Context**: Property listings show neighborhood Wikipedia articles
- **Confidence Scoring**: Higher quality results using confidence metrics
- **Relationship Filtering**: Find neighborhoods with parks, landmarks, historical sites
- **Direct Lookups**: Use page_id for fast Wikipedia article retrieval
- **Coverage Metrics**: Show Wikipedia knowledge completeness per neighborhood

### Technical Changes Required
1. Model updates to include correlation structures
2. Loader modifications to preserve correlations  
3. Enricher updates to maintain correlations
4. Elasticsearch mappings for nested structures
5. Query enhancements for correlation search

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Test
Create `data_pipeline/integration_tests/test_wikipedia_correlations.py`:
- Test model creation with sample data
- Verify loader preserves correlations from JSON
- Confirm enricher maintains correlations
- Validate Elasticsearch indexing with nested structures
- Test query functionality with correlation filters

## Migration Strategy

### Atomic Update Process
1. Update all models in single commit
2. Modify loader, enricher, and writer together
3. Recreate Elasticsearch indices with new mappings
4. Reload neighborhood data with correlations
5. Deploy enhanced search queries

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Index Size**: Nested correlations increase storage (~20% estimated)
- **Query Performance**: Nested queries may be slower than flat structure
- **Missing Data**: Some neighborhoods may lack correlations

### Mitigations
- Optimize mappings for common query patterns
- Use doc_values for frequently accessed fields
- Implement null-safe handling throughout pipeline

## Success Criteria

1. Wikipedia correlations preserved from source JSON to Elasticsearch
2. Nested structures properly indexed and searchable
3. Query performance remains under 100ms for correlation searches
4. Demo shows Wikipedia context in neighborhood and property results
5. All unit and integration tests passing

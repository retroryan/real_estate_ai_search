   - Entity-specific validation

3. **Modular Design**
   - Each entity has dedicated extractor
   - Each writer supports all entities
   - Clean dependency injection

#### Areas for Improvement

### 🚨 Critical Code Quality Issues

#### Issue 1: Error Handling Inconsistency
**Location**: Various extractors
**Problem**: Some extractors silently log errors without propagating
```python
# Current (Silent failure)
try:
    for row in counties.collect():
        # processing
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error creating county nodes: {e}")
    # Continues without raising!
```

**Recommendation**: Implement consistent error handling strategy
```python
# Better
try:
    for row in counties.collect():
        # processing
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error creating county nodes: {e}")
    raise PipelineExecutionError(f"Failed to extract counties: {e}")
```

#### Issue 2: Magic Numbers and Hard-coded Values
**Location**: Multiple files
**Problem**: Hard-coded values scattered throughout
```python
# Current
if row["city_count"] is not None else 0  # Magic default
dimension: 1024  # Hard-coded embedding size
```

**Recommendation**: Centralize configuration
```python
# Better
from data_pipeline.config.constants import (
    DEFAULT_CITY_COUNT,
    EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS
)
```

#### Issue 3: Inefficient DataFrame Operations
**Location**: Entity extractors
**Problem**: Multiple collect() operations causing performance issues
```python
# Current (Inefficient)
for row in counties.collect():  # Brings all data to driver
    county_nodes.append(county_node.model_dump())
```

**Recommendation**: Use Spark operations
```python
# Better
county_nodes_df = counties.rdd.map(
    lambda row: create_county_node(row)
).toDF()
```

#### Issue 4: Duplicate Code Patterns
**Location**: Writers (parquet_writer.py)
**Problem**: Repeated write methods with identical structure
```python
def write_features(self, df: DataFrame) -> bool:
    # 20 lines of identical code
def write_property_types(self, df: DataFrame) -> bool:
    # Same 20 lines with different path
```

**Recommendation**: DRY principle
```python
def _write_entity(self, df: DataFrame, entity_name: str) -> bool:
    """Generic entity writer."""
    try:
        output_path = self.base_path / entity_name
        df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet(str(output_path))
        self.logger.info(f"✓ Successfully wrote {entity_name} records")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to write {entity_name} data: {e}")
        return False

def write_features(self, df: DataFrame) -> bool:
    return self._write_entity(df, "features")
```

### 📝 Code Cleanliness Issues

#### Issue 5: Commented Out Code
**Location**: Multiple files
**Problem**: Dead code and TODO comments
```python
# TODO: Implement this later
# old_implementation()
# This was the old way
```

**Recommendation**: Remove all commented code, use git history

#### Issue 6: Inconsistent Naming
**Location**: Throughout
**Problem**: Mix of naming conventions
```python
PropertyTypeExtractor  # Class
extract_property_types  # Method
property_type_df  # Variable
PropertyType  # Model
```

**Recommendation**: Establish naming convention document

#### Issue 7: Missing Type Hints
**Location**: Various utility functions
**Problem**: Incomplete type annotations
```python
# Current
def generate_county_id(name, state):
    return f"county_{name}_{state}".lower()
```

**Recommendation**: Full type hints
```python
# Better
def generate_county_id(name: str, state: str) -> str:
    """Generate unique county identifier."""
    return f"county_{name}_{state}".lower().replace(" ", "_")
```

### 🏗️ Modularity Assessment

#### Well-Modularized Components ✅
1. **Entity Models** - Clean Pydantic models with validation
2. **Writer Interface** - Clear abstract base with implementations
3. **Configuration** - Centralized with environment support

#### Needs Better Modularization ⚠️
1. **Pipeline Runner** - 900+ line file doing too much
2. **Relationship Building** - Mixed into extractors
3. **Schema Management** - Scattered across files

### 🔧 Recommended Refactorings

#### Refactoring 1: Extract Pipeline Phases
```python
# Current: Monolithic pipeline_runner.py
class DataPipelineRunner:
    def run_full_pipeline_with_embeddings(self):
        # 500+ lines of mixed concerns

# Better: Separate phase handlers
class EntityExtractionPhase:
    def execute(self, data: Dict) -> Dict

class RelationshipBuildingPhase:
    def execute(self, entities: Dict) -> Dict

class EmbeddingGenerationPhase:
    def execute(self, data: Dict) -> Dict
```

#### Refactoring 2: Centralize Schema Management
```python
# Create: data_pipeline/schemas/catalog.py
class SchemaCatalog:
    """Central schema registry."""
    
    ENTITIES = {
        EntityType.PROPERTY: PropertySchema,
        EntityType.FEATURE: FeatureSchema,
        # ...
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def get_schema(cls, entity_type: EntityType):
        return cls.ENTITIES[entity_type]
```

#### Refactoring 3: Implement Builder Pattern for Complex Objects
```python
# Current: Complex nested dict creation
entity_configs = {
    EntityType.PROPERTY: ("Property", "listing_id"),
    # ...
}

# Better: Builder pattern
class Neo4jConfigBuilder:
    def add_entity(self, entity_type, label, key_field):
        # ...
    def build(self):
        return Neo4jConfiguration(...)
```

## Part 3: Specific Code Improvements

### 1. Pipeline Runner Modularization
**File**: `data_pipeline/core/pipeline_runner.py`
**Issue**: 900+ lines, multiple responsibilities
**Solution**: Split into:
- `pipeline_orchestrator.py` - Main flow
- `phase_handlers/` directory with phase-specific handlers
- `pipeline_state.py` - State management

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
**Create**: `data_pipeline/core/exceptions.py`
```python
class PipelineException(Exception):
    """Base pipeline exception."""
    pass

class EntityExtractionError(PipelineException):
    """Entity extraction failed."""
    pass

class WriterError(PipelineException):
    """Writer operation failed."""
    pass

class ConfigurationError(PipelineException):
    """Invalid configuration."""
    pass
```

### 3. Configuration Constants
**Create**: `data_pipeline/config/constants.py`
```python
# Entity defaults
DEFAULT_CITY_COUNT = 0
DEFAULT_MEDIAN_PRICE = None

# Processing limits
MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 10000
MAX_COLLECT_SIZE = 100000

# Embedding configuration
EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS = {
    "voyage-3": 1024,
    "voyage-large-2": 1536,
    "openai": 1536
}
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations
**Issue**: Inefficient DataFrame operations
**Solution**: Batch processing utilities
```python
# Create: data_pipeline/utils/spark_utils.py
def process_in_batches(df: DataFrame, batch_size: int, 
                       processor: Callable) -> DataFrame:
    """Process DataFrame in memory-efficient batches."""
    # Implementation
```

## Part 4: Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Gaps
1. No integration tests for full pipeline
2. No unit tests for extractors
3. No validation of relationships
4. No performance benchmarks

### Recommended Test Suite
```python
# tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py
def test_full_pipeline_execution():
    """Verify all entities and relationships created."""
    
# tests/unit/extractors/test_feature_extractor.py
def test_feature_extraction():
    """Verify feature extraction logic."""
    
# tests/performance/test_large_datasets.py
def test_memory_usage():
    """Ensure memory stays within bounds."""
```

## Part 5: Documentation Needs

### Missing Documentation
1. Architecture diagram
2. Data flow documentation
3. Entity relationship diagram
4. Configuration guide
5. Troubleshooting guide

## Executive Summary

This proposal extends the simplified historical data system to individual properties. Following the successful implementation for neighborhoods, properties will receive annual historical price data spanning 10 years. Each property's historical prices will track its neighborhood's trends while maintaining individual variation, creating realistic property-specific price histories for demonstration purposes.

## Core Requirements

### Data Structure
Each property will have historical data consisting of annual price records for the years 2015 through 2024. This provides a decade of price history suitable for trend analysis and demonstration scenarios.

### Price Calculation
Property historical prices will be calculated by taking the neighborhood's average price trend and applying individual property variation. Each property will vary within plus or minus five percent of its neighborhood's average appreciation rate, creating realistic differentiation while maintaining neighborhood cohesion.

### Integration Points
Historical data will be generated during the silver layer transformation, stored as JSON in DuckDB, passed through the gold layer unchanged, and indexed in Elasticsearch as a simple array of annual records.

## Design Principles

### Simplicity First
The implementation maintains extreme simplicity with only year and price fields per historical record. No complex metrics, no quarterly data, no market cycles - just annual prices that demonstrate historical trends.

### Neighborhood Correlation
Properties naturally follow their neighborhood's economic trends. A property in an appreciating neighborhood will show appreciation, while maintaining its relative position within the neighborhood's price range.

### Deterministic Generation
Each property's historical data is generated deterministically based on its property ID, ensuring consistent results across pipeline runs while providing appropriate variation between properties.

## Data Model

### Historical Record Structure
Each annual historical record for a property contains exactly two fields: the year as an integer and the price as a floating-point number. This minimal structure ensures clean serialization and simple queries.

### Storage Format
Historical data is stored as a JSON array in the silver and gold layers, maintaining consistency with the neighborhood implementation. The array contains exactly 10 objects, one for each year from 2015 to 2024.

### Elasticsearch Representation
In Elasticsearch, the historical data appears as a simple object array, enabling straightforward queries and aggregations without nested field complexity.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Generation Integration

**Objective:** Integrate property historical data generation into the silver layer transformation process.

**Todo List:**
1. Update property silver transformer to generate historical data during processing
2. Retrieve neighborhood historical averages for correlation
3. Apply property-specific variation within five percent bounds
4. Generate exactly 10 annual price records per property
5. Store historical data as JSON in silver layer
6. Validate generation produces consistent results
7. Code review and testing

### Phase 2: Gold Layer Pass-Through

**Objective:** Ensure historical data flows cleanly through the gold layer enrichment process.

**Todo List:**
1. Update property gold enricher to include historical data field
2. Pass historical data through without modification
3. Maintain field ordering and structure
4. Verify data integrity in gold view
5. Update any gold layer documentation
6. Code review and testing

### Phase 3: Elasticsearch Template Update

**Objective:** Configure Elasticsearch to properly index and store property historical data.

**Todo List:**
1. Update properties index template with historical data mapping
2. Define historical data as object type with year and price fields
3. Set appropriate data types for year and price
4. Ensure template allows for array of historical records
5. Validate template syntax and compatibility
6. Code review and testing

### Phase 4: Writer Transformation

**Objective:** Update the Elasticsearch writer to properly handle and transform historical data.

**Todo List:**
1. Update property document model to include historical data field
2. Add JSON parsing logic for historical data from DuckDB
3. Handle potential parsing errors gracefully
4. Transform historical data to list of dictionaries for Elasticsearch
5. Ensure proper field mapping during document creation
6. Code review and testing

### Phase 5: Integration Validation

**Objective:** Verify end-to-end functionality of property historical data.

**Todo List:**
1. Run complete pipeline with sample properties
2. Verify historical data generates for all properties
3. Confirm data flows through all layers correctly
4. Query Elasticsearch to validate indexed historical data
5. Test historical data aggregations and searches
6. Document any edge cases or limitations
7. Code review and testing

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
Every property in the system must have exactly 10 years of historical price data. The data must be searchable and retrievable from Elasticsearch. Price trends must correlate with neighborhood averages while showing individual variation.

### Technical Requirements
The implementation must maintain clean code principles with no type casting, no isinstance checks, and proper Pydantic models throughout. JSON serialization must work reliably across all pipeline layers. No performance degradation should occur from the additional data.

### Quality Standards
All code must follow Python best practices with clear documentation and appropriate error handling. The implementation must be maintainable and understandable by other developers. No dead code or commented-out sections should remain.

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Consistency
By using deterministic generation based on property IDs, we ensure consistent historical data across pipeline runs. This eliminates randomness-related bugs and makes testing predictable.

### Performance Impact
With only 10 annual records per property, the data volume remains minimal. The simple structure ensures fast serialization and deserialization. Elasticsearch can efficiently index and query this data without performance concerns.

### Maintenance Burden
The extremely simple data model minimizes maintenance requirements. No complex business logic means fewer bugs and easier debugging. Following the established neighborhood pattern reduces learning curve.

## Expected Outcomes

### Demonstration Value
Properties will display realistic price histories that enhance demonstration scenarios. Users can analyze price trends over time for individual properties. Comparison between properties in the same neighborhood becomes meaningful.

### Technical Benefits
Clean integration with existing pipeline architecture is achieved. Consistent patterns between neighborhood and property implementations reduce complexity. Simple data structures ensure reliable operation.

### Future Extensibility
While keeping the current implementation simple, the structure allows for future enhancements if needed. Additional metrics could be added following the same pattern. The annual structure could be refined to quarterly if required, though this is not recommended for demonstration purposes.

## Recommendation

Proceed with this simplified implementation immediately following the successful neighborhood historical data deployment. The straightforward approach ensures quick implementation with minimal risk. By maintaining consistency with the neighborhood pattern, we leverage proven code patterns and reduce potential issues.

The property historical data will complete the historical data feature set, providing comprehensive temporal context for both neighborhoods and individual properties in the demonstration system.

# Demo Cleanup Proposal - Complete Cut-Over Implementation

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* **FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENTS EXACTLY!!!** Do not add new features or functionality beyond the specific requirements requested and documented
* **ALWAYS FIX THE CORE ISSUE!** 
* **COMPLETE CHANGE:** All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION:** Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES:** Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO ROLLBACK PLANS!!** Never create rollback plans
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES:** Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS or Backwards Compatibility:** Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE:** Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION:** Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS:** Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED** and change the actual methods. For example if there is a class PropertyIndex and we want to improve that do not create a separate ImprovedPropertyIndex and instead just update the actual PropertyIndex
* **ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC**
* **USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE!**
* **Never name things after the phases or steps of the proposal and process documents.** So never test_phase_2_bronze_layer.py etc.
* **if hasattr should never be used.** And never use isinstance
* **Never cast variables or cast variable names or add variable aliases**
* **If you are using a union type something is wrong.** Go back and evaluate the core issue of why you need a union
* **If it doesn't work don't hack and mock.** Fix the core issue
* **If there are questions please ask me!!!**
* **Do not generate mocks or sample data if the actual results are missing.** Find out why the data is missing and if still not found ask.

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the complete removal of 12 demo queries that involve semantic search, embedding-based features, and certain location-aware functionality. The removal will be executed as a single atomic update with no migration period or backwards compatibility. All demo numbers will be renumbered sequentially after removal.

## Demos to be Removed

The following demos will be completely removed from the system:

* **Demo 6:** Semantic Similarity Search - Find similar properties using embeddings
* **Demo 7:** Multi-Entity Combined Search - Search across all entity types
* **Demo 8:** Wikipedia Article Search - Search Wikipedia with location filters
* **Demo 11:** Natural Language Semantic Search - Convert natural language queries to embeddings for semantic search
* **Demo 13:** Semantic vs Keyword Comparison - Compare semantic embedding search with traditional keyword search
* **Demo 19:** Location-Aware: Urban Modern - Modern urban property search with neighborhood understanding
* **Demo 21:** Location-Aware: Historic Urban - Historic property search in urban neighborhoods
* **Demo 22:** Location-Aware: Beach Proximity - Beach property search with proximity-based location understanding
* **Demo 23:** Location-Aware: Investment Market - Investment property search with market-specific targeting
* **Demo 24:** Location-Aware: Luxury Urban Views - Luxury urban property search emphasizing premium views
* **Demo 25:** Location-Aware: Suburban Architecture - Architectural style search in suburban markets
* **Demo 26:** Location-Aware: Neighborhood Character - Neighborhood character search with architectural details

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Atomic Update:** All changes must be made in a single commit
2. **No Breaking Changes:** All remaining demos must work exactly as before
3. **Clean Removal:** No commented code, no compatibility layers, no migration code
4. **Correct Renumbering:** Sequential numbering with no gaps (1-16)
5. **Complete Documentation:** All references updated to new numbering

## Verification Checklist

After implementation, verify:

- [ ] All 16 remaining demos execute successfully
- [ ] Demo numbers are sequential from 1 to 16
- [ ] No references to removed demo numbers exist in code
- [ ] No references to removed demo numbers exist in documentation
- [ ] Shell script shows correct demo listings
- [ ] No import errors when running demos
- [ ] Demo 15 (showcase) runs without calling removed demos
- [ ] No semantic search or embedding-related code remains for removed demos

## Notes

- Demo 28 (Wikipedia Location Search) becomes Demo 16 in the new numbering
- The default demo changes from 14 to 9 (Rich Real Estate Listing)
- The hybrid demos now start at Demo 10 instead of Demo 15
- Total demo count reduces from 28 to 16

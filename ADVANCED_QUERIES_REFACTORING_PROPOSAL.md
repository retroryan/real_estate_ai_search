# Advanced Queries Module Refactoring Proposal

## Complete Cut-Over Requirements

* FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENTS EXACTLY - Do not add new features or functionality beyond the specific requirements requested and documented
* ALWAYS FIX THE CORE ISSUE
* COMPLETE CHANGE - All occurrences must be changed in a single, atomic update
* CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION - Simple, direct replacements only
* NO MIGRATION PHASES - Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO ROLLBACK PLANS - Never create roll back plans
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES - Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS or Backwards Compatibility - Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE - Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION - Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS - Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED - Update the actual methods
* ALWAYS USE PYDANTIC
* USE MODULES AND CLEAN CODE
* Never name things after the phases or steps of the proposal
* No hasattr or isinstance usage
* Never cast variables or add variable aliases
* No union types - evaluate the core issue of why you need a union
* If it doesn't work don't hack and mock - Fix the core issue
* Do not generate mocks or sample data if actual results are missing - find out why

## Executive Summary

The advanced_queries.py file currently contains 1062 lines mixing semantic search, multi-entity search, Wikipedia search, display formatting, and Elasticsearch interaction logic. This proposal outlines a clean modular architecture that separates these concerns into focused, single-purpose modules under the advanced/ subdirectory. The old file will be completely replaced with the new modular structure.

## Current State Analysis

### Core Issues

1. **Mixed Responsibilities** - Single file handles query building, search execution, and display formatting for three different advanced search types
2. **Display Coupling** - Rich console formatting deeply embedded within search logic
3. **Complex Functions** - Each demo function spans 200-400 lines with multiple concerns
4. **Poor Testability** - Cannot test search logic without display side effects
5. **Limited Reusability** - Advanced search patterns not reusable outside demo context

### Current Structure

* demo_semantic_search function - Semantic similarity search with KNN (lines 30-305)
* demo_multi_entity_search function - Cross-index search (lines 308-609)
* demo_wikipedia_search function - Wikipedia article search with location filtering (lines 612-1061)
* Display logic interwoven throughout all functions
* Direct Elasticsearch client manipulation

## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility
Each module has exactly one reason to change:
* semantic_search changes when vector search logic changes
* multi_entity_search changes when cross-index logic changes
* wikipedia_search changes when Wikipedia filtering changes
* search_executor changes when Elasticsearch interaction changes
* demo_runner changes when demo workflow changes
* display_service changes when output format changes

### Dependency Inversion
* Search builders don't depend on Elasticsearch client
* Display service doesn't depend on search logic
* Demo runner orchestrates but doesn't implement

### Interface Segregation
* Clear interfaces between modules
* Each search type has its own builder
* No fat interfaces or unused dependencies

### Open/Closed Principle
* New search types can be added without modifying existing code
* New display formats can be added without touching search logic
* Demo workflows extensible through composition

## Implementation Benefits

### Improved Testability
* Search logic testable without Elasticsearch
* Display logic testable without searches
* Each search type independently testable
* Mock boundaries are clear and minimal

### Better Maintainability
* Changes isolated to specific search types
* Easier to understand individual search patterns
* Clear separation between search types

### Enhanced Reusability
* Semantic search usable outside demos
* Multi-entity search patterns reusable
* Wikipedia search logic available for other use cases
* Display service usable for other advanced searches

### Reduced Complexity
* Each module under 250 lines
* Single search pattern per file
* Clear data flow between modules

## Migration Strategy

### Data Flow
1. DemoRunner receives demo type and parameters
2. DemoRunner calls appropriate SearchBuilder
3. SearchBuilder constructs typed SearchRequest
4. DemoRunner passes request to SearchExecutor
5. SearchExecutor returns typed results
6. DemoRunner passes results to DisplayService
7. DisplayService formats and outputs results

### Interface Contracts

**SemanticSearchBuilder Interface**:
```
build_similarity_search(reference_embedding, size) -> SearchRequest
get_reference_property(property_id) -> ReferenceProperty
build_random_property_query() -> SearchRequest
```

**MultiEntitySearchBuilder Interface**:
```
build_multi_index_search(query_text, indices, size) -> SearchRequest
build_entity_aggregation() -> AggregationRequest
```

**WikipediaSearchBuilder Interface**:
```
build_location_search(city, state, topics, size) -> SearchRequest
build_neighborhood_association_search(city, state) -> SearchRequest
build_specific_neighborhood_search(neighborhood_name) -> SearchRequest
```

**SearchExecutor Interface**:
```
execute_semantic(request: SearchRequest) -> SemanticSearchResponse
execute_multi_entity(request: SearchRequest) -> MultiEntityResponse
execute_wikipedia(request: SearchRequest) -> WikipediaResponse
```

**DemoRunner Interface**:
```
run_semantic_search(reference_id, size) -> PropertySearchResult
run_multi_entity_search(query_text, size) -> MixedEntityResult
run_wikipedia_search(city, state, topics, size) -> WikipediaSearchResult
```

**DisplayService Interface**:
```
display_semantic_results(result: PropertySearchResult, reference: ReferenceProperty) -> None
display_multi_entity_results(result: MixedEntityResult) -> None
display_wikipedia_results(result: WikipediaSearchResult) -> None
display_error(message: str) -> None
```

## Implementation Notes

### Key Differences from Property Module
* Three distinct search types vs single query builder
* More complex display requirements
* Cross-index search handling
* Vector/embedding specific logic
* Wikipedia-specific filtering patterns

### Special Considerations
* Semantic search requires reference property handling
* Multi-entity search needs entity discrimination
* Wikipedia search has neighborhood association logic
* Display service must handle three distinct result types
* Each search type has unique Elasticsearch features

### Module Sizing Guidelines
* semantic_search.py: ~200 lines
* multi_entity_search.py: ~150 lines
* wikipedia_search.py: ~200 lines
* search_executor.py: ~250 lines
* demo_runner.py: ~200 lines
* display_service.py: ~250 lines
* Total: ~1250 lines (vs 1062 original)

The slight increase in total lines is acceptable given the clear separation of concerns and improved maintainability. Each module remains focused and under the 300-line guideline.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

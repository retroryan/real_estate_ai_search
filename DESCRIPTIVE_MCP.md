## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the addition of a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that provides rich, comprehensive property listings by leveraging the denormalized `property_relationships` index. The tool will return complete property details including embedded neighborhood information and Wikipedia context in a single, high-performance query.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the MCP server provides tools for searching properties and retrieving basic property details. However, creating a rich property listing like those shown in Demo 14 requires multiple queries:
- Query 1: Property details from properties index
- Query 2: Neighborhood information from neighborhoods index  
- Query 3-5: Wikipedia articles from wiki indices

This multi-query approach results in:
- **Performance overhead**: ~250ms for 5 separate queries
- **Complex client logic**: Clients must orchestrate multiple API calls
- **Increased error handling**: Each query can fail independently
- **Network latency**: Multiple round trips to the server

## Solution Overview

Add a new MCP tool `get_rich_property_details_tool` that leverages the existing denormalized `property_relationships` index to return comprehensive property information in a single query.

### Key Benefits
- **Single Query Performance**: 2-5ms response time (125x faster)
- **Complete Data**: All property, neighborhood, and Wikipedia data in one response
- **Simplified Client Logic**: One API call instead of five
- **Consistent Data**: All related data from same point in time
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Single request/response cycle

## Technical Architecture

### Data Source
The tool will query the `property_relationships` index which contains:
- Complete property details (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, features, etc.)
- Embedded neighborhood object with demographics and amenities
- Embedded Wikipedia articles array with summaries and relevance scores
- Combined text field for enhanced search capabilities

### Integration Pattern
The new tool follows the existing MCP server patterns:
1. **Tool Function**: Async function in `tools/property_tools.py`
2. **Service Layer**: Leverages existing `PropertySearchService` with new method
3. **Model Layer**: New Pydantic models for rich property response
4. **Registration**: Tool registered in `main.py` with FastMCP decorator

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Input Parameters
- `listing_id` (string, required): The unique property listing identifier
- `include_wikipedia` (boolean, optional, default=true): Include Wikipedia articles
- `include_neighborhood` (boolean, optional, default=true): Include neighborhood data
- `wikipedia_limit` (integer, optional, default=3): Maximum Wikipedia articles to return

#### Output Structure
The tool returns a structured JSON response containing:
- Complete property details including all core fields (type, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, etc.)
- Full address with street, city, state, zip code and geo-location coordinates
- Rich property description and arrays of features/amenities
- Status and market information (listing date, days on market, price per square foot)
- Additional details like parking, virtual tour URLs, and property images
- Embedded neighborhood object with demographics, scores, and local amenities
- Array of Wikipedia articles with titles, summaries, and relevance scores
- Metadata including data version, execution time, and source index

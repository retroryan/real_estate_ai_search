DEMO 2: GRAPH ANALYSIS WITH EMBEDDING-BASED SIMILARITY
========================================================

This demo showcases graph analysis capabilities using embeddings for
similarity search instead of pre-computed SIMILAR_TO relationships.

Key Capabilities Demonstrated:
1. Property location relationships and geographic patterns
2. Embedding-based similarity search on demand
3. Feature co-occurrence analysis
4. Neighborhood proximity networks
5. Market segmentation through graph traversals

Database Context:
- Properties with embeddings for similarity calculation
- Rich feature relationships (HAS_FEATURE)
- Geographic hierarchy (LOCATED_IN, IN_CITY, IN_COUNTY)
- Neighborhood proximity (NEAR) relationships

DEMO 2: GRAPH RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS SHOWCASE
=============================================

This demo showcases the power of Neo4j graph relationships for real estate intelligence.
It demonstrates complex graph traversals, relationship analysis, and pattern discovery
that would be impossible with traditional vector search alone.

Key Capabilities Demonstrated:
1. Property similarity networks and clustering analysis
2. Feature co-occurrence patterns and correlation networks
3. Geographic relationship hierarchies and proximity analysis
4. Neighborhood lifestyle analysis and community insights
5. Market segment analysis through graph traversals
6. Investment opportunity discovery through relationship patterns

Graph Database Context:
- 6,447 total relationships across 8 relationship types
- 1,608 property similarities with calculated scores (0.720-1.000 range)
- 3,257 feature relationships across 416 unique features
- Geographic hierarchy: County -> City -> Neighborhood -> Property
- Complex similarity networks with high connectivity (avg 11 connections per hub)

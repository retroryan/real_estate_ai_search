## üìö Cypher Query Types and Concepts

### Core Query Patterns Explained

#### 1. **Node Pattern Matching**
- **What it is**: Finding nodes based on labels and properties using graph patterns
- **How it works**:
  - Pattern matching syntax: `(variable:Label {property: value})`
  - Labels act as node types/categories (e.g., Property, Neighborhood, Feature)
  - Properties filter within label sets using exact or range matches
  - Variables capture matched nodes for further processing
- **Pattern structure**:
  ```cypher
  (p:Property {property_type: "Condo"})  // Node with label and property
  (n:Neighborhood)                       // Node with just label
  (:Feature)-[:HAS_FEATURE]->(p)        // Anonymous node in relationship
  ```
- **Use case**: Finding specific entities like properties, neighborhoods, or features
- **Performance**: O(log n) with indexes on labels and properties

#### 2. **Relationship Traversal Queries**
- **What it is**: Following connections between nodes to discover related entities
- **How it works**:
  - Relationship patterns: `-[r:TYPE]->` for directed, `-[r:TYPE]-` for undirected
  - Variable-length paths: `-[:TYPE*1..3]->` traverses 1 to 3 hops
  - Path binding captures entire traversal sequences
  - Breadth-first search by default, configurable traversal strategies
- **Traversal patterns**:
  ```cypher
  (p:Property)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:Neighborhood)     // Direct relationship
  (p1:Property)-[:SIMILAR_TO*1..2]-(p2:Property)   // Variable-length path
  path = (p:Property)-[*]-(n:Neighborhood)         // Any path between nodes
  ```
- **Use case**: Finding connected entities, relationship chains, network paths
- **Performance**: O(b^d) where b=branching factor, d=depth

#### 3. **Graph Aggregation Queries**
- **What it is**: Statistical analysis across graph relationships and node sets
- **How it works**:
  - `WITH` clauses create processing pipelines
  - Aggregation functions: count(), avg(), sum(), min(), max(), collect()
  - `GROUP BY` implicit through non-aggregated variables in WITH/RETURN
  - Multi-stage aggregations possible through chained WITH clauses
- **Aggregation patterns**:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Property)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:Neighborhood)
  WITH n, count(p) as property_count, avg(p.listing_price) as avg_price
  RETURN n.name, property_count, avg_price
  ORDER BY property_count DESC
  ```
- **Use case**: Market statistics, distribution analysis, relationship metrics
- **Performance**: O(n) scan with O(1) aggregation operations

#### 4. **Path Finding Queries**
- **What it is**: Discovering optimal paths between nodes using Neo4j's graph algorithms
- **How it works**:
  - Shortest path: Uses Dijkstra's or A* algorithms
  - All paths: Exhaustive search with optional constraints
  - Path predicates filter during traversal
  - Cost functions weight edges for optimal path calculation
- **Path algorithms**:
  ```cypher
  // Shortest path between properties
  MATCH path = shortestPath((p1:Property)-[*]-(p2:Property))
  WHERE p1.id = 1 AND p2.id = 100
  RETURN path, length(path) as hops
  
  // All paths with constraints
  MATCH path = (p1:Property)-[:SIMILAR_TO*1..3]-(p2:Property)
  WHERE ALL(r IN relationships(path) WHERE r.similarity_score > 0.8)
  RETURN path
  ```
- **Use case**: Connection discovery, optimal routes, influence paths
- **Performance**: O((b^d)/2) for bidirectional search

#### 5. **Neighborhood Subgraph Queries**
- **What it is**: Extracting connected components and local graph structures
- **How it works**:
  - Expands from seed nodes to specified depth
  - Collects nodes and relationships into subgraphs
  - Optional filtering during expansion
  - Returns complete neighborhood structures
- **Subgraph patterns**:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Property {id: 123})
  CALL apoc.path.subgraphAll(p, {
    maxLevel: 2,
    relationshipFilter: "SIMILAR_TO|HAS_FEATURE"
  })
  YIELD nodes, relationships
  RETURN nodes, relationships
  ```
- **Use case**: Local graph exploration, impact analysis, cluster extraction
- **Performance**: O(b^d) with early termination optimizations

#### 6. **Similarity and Recommendation Queries**
- **What it is**: Finding similar entities based on shared relationships and properties
- **How it works**:
  - Collaborative filtering through shared connections
  - Jaccard similarity on feature sets
  - Weighted similarity scores from multiple factors
  - Vector similarity using stored embeddings
- **Similarity patterns**:
  ```cypher
  // Feature-based similarity
  MATCH (p1:Property)-[:HAS_FEATURE]->(f:Feature)<-[:HAS_FEATURE]-(p2:Property)
  WHERE p1.id = 123
  WITH p2, count(f) as shared_features, 
       collect(f.name) as features
  RETURN p2, shared_features, 
         shared_features * 1.0 / p2.total_features as jaccard_similarity
  ORDER BY shared_features DESC
  ```
- **Use case**: Property recommendations, similar listings, market comparables
- **Performance**: O(n*m) where n=nodes, m=average connections

#### 7. **Temporal Graph Queries**
- **What it is**: Analyzing changes and patterns over time in graph structures
- **How it works**:
  - Time-based filtering on relationship properties
  - Temporal ordering of events and changes
  - Time-window aggregations
  - Historical path analysis
- **Temporal patterns**:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Property)-[s:SOLD]->(b:Buyer)
  WHERE s.date >= date('2023-01-01')
  WITH p, s.price as sale_price, s.date as sale_date
  ORDER BY sale_date
  RETURN p.address, sale_price, sale_date,
         sale_price - p.original_price as appreciation
  ```
- **Use case**: Market trends, price evolution, seasonal patterns
- **Performance**: O(n log n) with temporal indexes

#### 8. **Graph Pattern Detection**
- **What it is**: Identifying specific structural patterns within the graph
- **How it works**:
  - Complex MATCH patterns define structures
  - WHERE clauses add semantic constraints
  - Pattern comprehension for collection
  - Negative patterns with NOT EXISTS
- **Pattern detection examples**:
  ```cypher
  // Triangle patterns (mutual connections)
  MATCH (p1:Property)-[:SIMILAR_TO]-(p2:Property),
        (p2)-[:SIMILAR_TO]-(p3:Property),
        (p3)-[:SIMILAR_TO]-(p1)
  WHERE p1.id < p2.id < p3.id  // Avoid duplicates
  RETURN p1, p2, p3 as similarity_triangle
  
  // Hub detection (highly connected nodes)
  MATCH (p:Property)-[r:SIMILAR_TO]-()
  WITH p, count(r) as connections
  WHERE connections > 10
  RETURN p as hub_property, connections
  ```
- **Use case**: Community detection, anomaly identification, structural analysis
- **Performance**: O(n^k) for k-node patterns, optimizable with indexes

#### 9. **Hybrid Vector-Graph Queries**
- **What it is**: Combining Neo4j's native vector search with graph relationships
- **How it works**:
  - Vector indexes on node properties (1024-dim embeddings)
  - Cosine similarity for semantic matching
  - Graph boosting adjusts vector scores
  - Relationship-aware reranking
- **Hybrid patterns**:
  ```cypher
  // Vector search with graph boost
  CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('propertyEmbeddings', 50, $queryVector)
  YIELD node as p, score as vector_score
  MATCH (p)-[r:SIMILAR_TO]-(similar:Property)
  WITH p, vector_score, count(similar) as graph_connections
  RETURN p, vector_score * (1 + log(1 + graph_connections)) as hybrid_score
  ORDER BY hybrid_score DESC
  ```
- **Use case**: Semantic search with relationship context, enhanced recommendations
- **Performance**: O(log n) vector search + O(m) graph traversal

#### 10. **Complex Aggregation Pipelines**
- **What it is**: Multi-stage data processing combining graph traversal with analytics
- **How it works**:
  - Sequential WITH clauses create processing stages
  - Each stage can filter, aggregate, or transform
  - UNWIND expands collections for processing
  - CASE expressions for conditional logic
- **Pipeline example**:
  ```cypher
  // Multi-level market analysis
  MATCH (p:Property)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:Neighborhood)-[:IN_CITY]->(c:City)
  WITH c, n, count(p) as properties_in_neighborhood, 
       avg(p.listing_price) as neighborhood_avg_price
  WITH c, collect({
    neighborhood: n.name, 
    count: properties_in_neighborhood,
    avg_price: neighborhood_avg_price
  }) as neighborhoods
  RETURN c.name as city,
         size(neighborhoods) as total_neighborhoods,
         reduce(s = 0, n IN neighborhoods | s + n.count) as total_properties,
         reduce(s = 0.0, n IN neighborhoods | s + n.avg_price) / size(neighborhoods) as city_avg_price
  ORDER BY total_properties DESC
  ```
- **Use case**: Hierarchical analytics, market intelligence, complex reporting
- **Performance**: O(n) with efficient aggregation algorithms

## üîÑ Graph-Enhanced Hybrid Search

### Multi-Stage Hybrid Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Vector Retrieval
```cypher
// Initial semantic search
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('propertyEmbeddings', 50, $queryVector)
YIELD node as p, score as vector_score
WITH p, vector_score
```

#### Stage 2: Graph Intelligence Layer
```cypher
// Enhance with relationship data
MATCH (p)-[sim:SIMILAR_TO]-(similar:Property)
WHERE sim.overall_score > 0.8
WITH p, vector_score, avg(sim.overall_score) as relationship_score, 
     count(similar) as connection_count
```

#### Stage 3: Feature Correlation
```cypher
// Boost based on matching features
MATCH (p)-[:HAS_FEATURE]->(f:Feature)
WHERE f.name IN $desired_features
WITH p, vector_score, relationship_score, connection_count,
     count(f) as matching_features
```

#### Stage 4: Hybrid Scoring
```cypher
// Combine all signals
WITH p,
     vector_score * 0.4 +                                    // Semantic similarity
     relationship_score * 0.3 +                              // Graph relationships
     (matching_features * 1.0 / $total_features) * 0.2 +    // Feature matching
     (log(1 + connection_count) / 10) * 0.1                 // Network effect
     as hybrid_score
RETURN p, hybrid_score
ORDER BY hybrid_score DESC
```

## üí° Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. **Query Optimization**
   - Use indexes for starting points: `CREATE INDEX ON :Property(id)`
   - Limit traversal depth: `[:SIMILAR_TO*1..3]` not `[:SIMILAR_TO*]`
   - Filter early in the query: WHERE clauses before MATCH when possible
   - Use PROFILE to analyze query plans: `PROFILE MATCH ...`

### 2. **Relationship Design**
   - Store computed scores in relationships: `SIMILAR_TO.overall_score`
   - Use relationship properties for filtering: `WHERE r.score > 0.8`
   - Design for traversal patterns: directed vs undirected relationships
   - Create specific relationship types: `LOCATED_IN` vs generic `RELATED_TO`

### 3. **Aggregation Patterns**
   - Use WITH for multi-stage processing pipelines
   - Collect before complex operations: `collect(p) as properties`
   - Leverage reduce() for accumulation: `reduce(s = 0, x IN list | s + x)`
   - Use UNWIND for array processing: `UNWIND $batch as item`

### 4. **Vector Integration**
   - Maintain embedding consistency: same model for all vectors
   - Index high-dimensional vectors: 1024-dim voyage-3 embeddings
   - Combine vector and graph scores: hybrid ranking algorithms
   - Pre-filter for efficiency: apply constraints before vector search

### 5. **Performance Tuning**
   - Batch operations: `UNWIND $batch AS item CREATE (p:Property) SET p = item`
   - Use EXPLAIN to understand query plans without execution
   - Leverage query caching for repeated patterns
   - Monitor with query logging: `dbms.logs.query.enabled=true`

### 6. **Graph Algorithm Usage**
   - Use built-in algorithms when available: `shortestPath()`, `allShortestPaths()`
   - Consider APOC for advanced operations: `apoc.path.expandConfig()`
   - Implement custom algorithms with Cypher: PageRank, community detection
   - Use Graph Data Science library for ML: node embeddings, link prediction

## üìä Query Performance Guidelines

### Index Strategy
```cypher
// Essential indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX property_id FOR (p:Property) ON (p.id);
CREATE INDEX property_type FOR (p:Property) ON (p.property_type);
CREATE INDEX neighborhood_name FOR (n:Neighborhood) ON (n.name);
CREATE INDEX feature_name FOR (f:Feature) ON (f.name);
CREATE INDEX feature_category FOR (f:Feature) ON (f.category);

// Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX property_location FOR (p:Property) ON (p.city, p.property_type);

// Vector index for semantic search
CALL db.index.vector.createNodeIndex(
  'propertyEmbeddings', 'Property', 'embedding', 1024, 'cosine'
);
```

### Query Optimization Checklist

- ‚úÖ **Use parameters**: `$param` instead of literal values for query caching
- ‚úÖ **Limit result sets**: Add LIMIT clauses to prevent large returns
- ‚úÖ **Profile queries**: Use PROFILE to identify bottlenecks
- ‚úÖ **Index backing**: Ensure starting points use indexes
- ‚úÖ **Avoid cartesian products**: Use directed traversals
- ‚úÖ **Filter early**: Apply WHERE clauses as soon as possible
- ‚úÖ **Batch operations**: Process multiple items in single transactions

### Memory Management
```cypher
// Configure heap memory for large graph operations
dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=4g
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=8g
dbms.memory.pagecache.size=4g

// Query memory limits
dbms.memory.transaction.global_max_size=2g
cypher.query_max_allocations=1000000000
```

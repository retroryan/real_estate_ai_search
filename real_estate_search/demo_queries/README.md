# Elasticsearch Demo Queries Guide

This directory contains demonstration queries showcasing various Elasticsearch search patterns and features. Each query demonstrates specific search concepts, from basic full-text search to complex aggregations and geo-spatial queries.

## üìö Query Types and Concepts

### Core Query Types Explained

#### 1. **Full-Text Search Queries**
- **What it is**: Analyzed text search that tokenizes, stems, and scores by relevance
- **How it works**: Text is broken into tokens, analyzed (lowercase, stemming), and matched using TF-IDF or BM25 scoring
- **Use case**: Finding documents containing words or phrases regardless of exact form

#### 2. **Term Queries**
- **What it is**: Exact match queries on non-analyzed fields (keywords)
- **How it works**: No analysis performed - exact byte-for-byte matching
- **Use case**: Filtering by categories, IDs, or exact values

#### 3. **Bool Queries**
- **What it is**: Compound queries combining multiple query clauses
- **Components**:
  - `must`: Clauses that must match (affects score)
  - `filter`: Clauses that must match (no score impact)
  - `should`: Optional clauses that boost score if matched
  - `must_not`: Clauses that must not match
- **Use case**: Complex searches with multiple criteria

#### 4. **Range Queries**
- **What it is**: Find documents with values within specified bounds
- **How it works**: Efficiently uses data structures to find numeric/date ranges
- **Use case**: Price ranges, date ranges, numeric thresholds

#### 5. **Geo Queries**
- **What it is**: Location-based searches using coordinates
- **Types**: geo_distance, geo_bounding_box, geo_polygon
- **Use case**: "Find properties within X miles of location"

#### 6. **Aggregation Queries**
- **What it is**: Analytics and statistics on search results
- **Types**: Metrics (avg, sum, min, max), Buckets (terms, histogram, date_histogram)
- **Use case**: Market analysis, statistics, grouping

#### 7. **Nested Queries**
- **What it is**: Query nested objects maintaining parent-child relationships
- **How it works**: Searches within nested documents independently
- **Use case**: Arrays of objects where relationships matter

#### 8. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) Queries**
- **What it is**: Vector similarity search using dense embeddings
- **How it works**: Finds k most similar vectors using distance metrics (cosine, L2, dot product)
- **Components**:
  - `field`: The dense_vector field to search
  - `query_vector`: The reference vector (1024 dimensions for voyage-3)
  - `k`: Number of nearest neighbors to find
  - `num_candidates`: Candidates per shard (accuracy vs speed tradeoff)
- **Use case**: Semantic similarity, recommendation systems, finding "similar" items

2. **Accuracy**: Approximate search with ~95% recall
3. **Scalability**: Works with millions of vectors
4. **Language Understanding**: Captures semantic meaning, not just keywords
5. **No Training Required**: Pre-trained voyage-3 model works out-of-box

## üí° Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Use Appropriate Query Types**
   - Full-text search: `match`, `multi_match`
   - Exact filtering: `term`, `terms`
   - Complex logic: `bool` query

2. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Use `filter` context for non-scoring clauses
   - Denormalize for read-heavy workloads
   - Use appropriate field types (keyword vs text)

3. **Enhance Relevance**
   - Boost important fields
   - Use should clauses for optional matches
   - Configure appropriate analyzers

4. **Structure for Maintainability**
   - Separate query building from execution
   - Use typed models for responses
   - Document query purposes

## üéì Learning Path

1. **Start Simple**: property_queries.py - Basic searches
2. **Add Filters**: Learn bool queries and exact matching
3. **Explore Text**: wikipedia_fulltext.py - Full-text features
4. **Analyze Data**: aggregation_queries.py - Statistics
5. **Go Complex**: advanced_queries.py - Multi-index search
6. **Optimize**: demo_single_query_relationships.py - Denormalization

## üìä Query Performance Tips

- **Filters before queries**: Apply filters in filter context
- **Limit field count**: Fewer fields to search = faster
- **Use source filtering**: Return only needed fields
- **Cache aggregations**: For repeated analytics
- **Profile queries**: Use `"profile": true` to analyze

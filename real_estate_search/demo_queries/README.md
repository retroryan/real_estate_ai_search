## üìö Query Types and Concepts

### Core Query Types Explained

#### 1. **Full-Text Search Queries**
- **What it is**: Analyzed text search that tokenizes, stems, and scores by relevance
- **How it works**: 
  - Text analysis pipeline: tokenization ‚Üí lowercase ‚Üí stop word removal ‚Üí stemming
  - Uses BM25 scoring algorithm (modern replacement for TF-IDF)
  - Inverted index lookup for efficient token matching
  - Relevance scoring considers term frequency, document frequency, field length normalization
- **Analysis process**:
  ```
  "modern luxury home" ‚Üí ["modern", "luxury", "home"] ‚Üí BM25 scoring ‚Üí ranked results
  ```
- **Use case**: Finding documents containing words or phrases regardless of exact form
- **Performance**: O(log n) index lookups, highly optimized for text search

#### 2. **Term Queries**
- **What it is**: Exact match queries on non-analyzed fields (keywords)
- **How it works**: 
  - No analysis performed - exact byte-for-byte matching
  - Uses term dictionary for O(1) lookups
  - Constant score queries (no relevance calculation)
  - Perfect for filtering and exact matching
- **Data structure**: Hash-based term dictionary with posting lists
- **Use case**: Filtering by categories, IDs, status values, exact values
- **Performance**: Extremely fast O(1) lookups

#### 3. **Bool Queries**
- **What it is**: Compound queries combining multiple query clauses using boolean logic
- **Components**:
  - `must`: Clauses that must match (affects score) - AND logic with scoring
  - `filter`: Clauses that must match (no score impact) - AND logic, constant score
  - `should`: Optional clauses that boost score if matched - OR logic with boosting
  - `must_not`: Clauses that must not match - NOT logic, excludes documents
- **Execution order**: Filters first (fastest), then must/should clauses
- **Score calculation**: Combines individual clause scores using Lucene's boolean scoring
- **Use case**: Complex searches with multiple criteria, faceted search, filtered queries
- **Performance**: Optimized with filter caching, early termination

#### 4. **Range Queries**
- **What it is**: Find documents with values within specified bounds
- **How it works**: 
  - Uses specialized data structures (BKD trees for numerics, trie for dates)
  - Binary search trees enable O(log n) range lookups
  - Supports inclusive/exclusive bounds: gte, gt, lte, lt
  - Automatic type coercion and validation
- **Data structures**: 
  - Numeric: Block KD-trees (BKD) for multi-dimensional range queries
  - Dates: Trie-based structures with millisecond precision
- **Use case**: Price ranges, date ranges, numeric thresholds, age filtering
- **Performance**: O(log n) lookups with excellent range scanning

#### 5. **Geo Queries**
- **What it is**: Location-based searches using geographic coordinates and shapes
- **Types**:
  - `geo_distance`: Radial search from a point
  - `geo_bounding_box`: Rectangular area search
  - `geo_polygon`: Custom polygon area search
  - `geo_shape`: Complex geometric shape queries
- **How it works**:
  - Uses geohash encoding for efficient spatial indexing
  - Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations
  - BKD trees for multi-dimensional geo data
  - Supports various distance units (km, miles, meters)
- **Use case**: "Find properties within X miles of location", area-based searches
- **Performance**: Logarithmic complexity with spatial indexing optimizations

#### 6. **Aggregation Queries**
- **What it is**: Analytics and statistics computation on search results or entire datasets
- **Types**:
  - **Metric Aggregations**: Single-value calculations (avg, sum, min, max, stats, cardinality)
  - **Bucket Aggregations**: Group data (terms, date_histogram, histogram, range)
  - **Pipeline Aggregations**: Operate on other aggregations (moving_avg, derivative)
  - **Matrix Aggregations**: Multi-field statistics (matrix_stats)
- **How it works**:
  - Post-query aggregation phase
  - Uses doc values (columnar storage) for performance
  - Distributed aggregation across shards with result merging
  - Memory-efficient streaming aggregations
- **Use case**: Market analysis, statistics, grouping, dashboards, analytics
- **Performance**: Optimized with doc values, approximate algorithms for large datasets

#### 7. **Nested Queries**
- **What it is**: Query nested objects maintaining parent-child relationships within documents
- **How it works**: 
  - Nested documents stored as separate Lucene documents
  - Special join queries maintain parent-child relationships
  - Independent scoring for nested matches
  - Supports nested aggregations and sorting
- **Document structure**: Flattened arrays lose relationships; nested preserves them
- **Use case**: Arrays of objects where relationships matter (product variants, contact info)
- **Performance**: Higher memory usage but maintains data integrity

#### 8. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) Queries**
- **What it is**: Vector similarity search using dense embeddings for semantic matching
- **How it works**: 
  - HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
  - Distance metrics: cosine similarity, L2 (Euclidean), dot product
  - Multi-layer graph structure for O(log n) search complexity
  - Approximate search with configurable accuracy/speed tradeoffs
- **Components**:
  - `field`: The dense_vector field to search (e.g., 1024-dimensional vectors)
  - `query_vector`: The reference embedding vector
  - `k`: Number of nearest neighbors to return
  - `num_candidates`: Candidates per shard (higher = more accurate, slower)
- **Vector generation**: Uses embedding models (voyage-3, OpenAI, etc.) to convert text ‚Üí vectors
- **Use case**: Semantic similarity, "find similar" recommendations, cross-lingual search
- **Performance**: Sub-linear O(log n) with HNSW, highly scalable

#### 9. **Hybrid Search Queries** ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **What it is**: Advanced search combining semantic vector search with traditional text search using RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
- **How it works**: 
  - **Step 1**: Execute parallel retrievers - text search (BM25) + vector search (KNN)
  - **Step 2**: Apply RRF algorithm to merge rankings from different retrievers
  - **Step 3**: Rerank results using reciprocal rank fusion formula
  - **RRF Formula**: `score = Œ£(1 / (k + rank_i))` where k is rank_constant
- **Modern Implementation**:
  ```json
  {
    "retriever": {
      "rrf": {
        "retrievers": [
          {"standard": {"query": {"multi_match": {"query": "text", "fields": ["field1^2", "field2"]}}}},
          {"knn": {"field": "embedding", "query_vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...], "k": 50}}
        ],
        "rank_constant": 60,
        "rank_window_size": 100
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - **Precision + Recall**: Combines exact keyword matching with semantic understanding
  - **Relevance**: RRF balances different ranking signals optimally
  - **Robustness**: Handles queries that work better with either text or vector search
  - **Modern**: Uses Elasticsearch 8.15+ native retriever syntax
- **Use case**: Best-of-both-worlds search, handling diverse query types, production search systems
- **Performance**: Parallel execution with efficient result merging

#### 10. **Location-Aware Hybrid Search** ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **What it is**: Intelligent hybrid search with automatic location extraction and geographic filtering
- **How it works**: 
  - **Step 1**: Natural language processing extracts location intent (city, state, regions)
  - **Step 2**: Applies geographic filters to both text and vector retrievers
  - **Step 3**: Uses cleaned query (location terms removed) for better semantic matching
  - **Step 4**: Combines location filtering with hybrid RRF search
- **Location Understanding**:
  - Uses DSPy modules for location entity recognition
  - Extracts cities, states, neighborhoods, regions
  - Builds appropriate Elasticsearch geo/term filters
  - Handles ambiguous locations and multi-location queries
- **Query Processing**:
  ```
  Input: "luxury condo in San Francisco with city views"
  Location Extraction: city="San Francisco", state="California"
  Cleaned Query: "luxury condo with city views" 
  Geo Filters: address.city="San Francisco", address.state="California"
  ```

## üß† KNN Vector Search Flow

### Semantic Search Pipeline

#### 1. Embedding Generation (Indexing)
```
Property Description: "Luxury waterfront home with panoramic ocean views"
         ‚Üì voyage-3 model
    1024-dimensional vector: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]
         ‚Üì Store in dense_vector field
    Indexed with HNSW algorithm for fast retrieval
```

#### 2. Query Embedding (Search Time)
```
Query: "beachfront property with sea views"
         ‚Üì Same voyage-3 model
    Query vector: [0.111, -0.444, 0.777, ...]
```

#### 3. KNN Search
```
knn: {
  field: "embedding",
  query_vector: [0.111, -0.444, 0.777, ...],
  k: 10,
  num_candidates: 100
}
         ‚Üì HNSW graph traversal
    Find 10 nearest vectors by cosine similarity
         ‚Üì Score by similarity (0-1 range)
    Return documents ranked by semantic similarity
```

#### 4. Hybrid Scoring (Optional)

## üîÑ Hybrid Search Execution Flow (RRF)

### Modern Hybrid Search Architecture

#### 1. Query Preparation Phase
```
Input Query: "modern kitchen stainless appliances"
         ‚Üì
Location Extraction: [None] (no location detected)
         ‚Üì
Cleaned Query: "modern kitchen stainless appliances" 
         ‚Üì
Embedding Generation: voyage-3 ‚Üí [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (1024-dim)
```

#### 2. Parallel Retriever Execution
```
Text Retriever (BM25):                    Vector Retriever (KNN):
multi_match query on:                      knn query on:
- description^2.0                         - field: "embedding"  
- features^1.5                            - query_vector: [0.123, ...]

doc3: rank=2         doc1: rank=2          doc2: 1/(60+4) + 1/(60+1) = 0.032  
doc7: rank=3         doc9: rank=3          doc3: 1/(60+2) + 0 = 0.016
doc2: rank=4         doc4: rank=4          doc7: 1/(60+3) + 0 = 0.016

Final Ranking: [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc7, doc9, doc4, ...]

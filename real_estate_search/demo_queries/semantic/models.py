"""
Pydantic models for semantic search functionality.

Currently, this module serves as a placeholder for future semantic-specific models.
The implementation uses PropertySearchResult from the parent module to maintain
consistency with the existing codebase.
"""

# Note: The semantic search implementation currently uses models from the parent modules:
# - PropertySearchResult from ..result_models
# - PropertyListing from ...models
# - AppConfig from ...config
#
# This file is maintained for potential future semantic-specific models
# while preserving the modular structure of the refactoring.

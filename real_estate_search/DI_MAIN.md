# Constructor Injection Architecture Proposal for Real Estate Search Demo

## Key Implementation Requirements

* **CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Simple, direct replacements only
* **NO MIGRATION PHASES**: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* **NO PARTIAL UPDATES**: Change everything or change nothing
* **NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* **NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE**: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* **NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS**: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* **NO ENHANCED/IMPROVED VERSIONS**: Update existing classes directly (e.g., update `PropertyIndexer`, not create `ImprovedPropertyIndexer`)
* **CONSISTENT NAMING**: Use snake_case throughout (Python convention)
* **USE PYDANTIC**: For all data models and validation
* **NO OPTIONAL IMPORTS**: All imports are required, no try/except on imports
* **USE LOGGING**: Replace all print statements with proper logging

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a complete refactoring of the Real Estate Search demo to use **Constructor Injection** throughout, creating a clean, testable, and maintainable codebase suitable for a high-quality demonstration. The refactoring will simplify the architecture while making dependencies explicit and manageable.

### Why "Dependency Container" with Constructor Injection?

The **Dependency Container** is not a contradiction to Constructor Injection - it's the **central factory** that creates all objects with their dependencies properly injected through constructors. Think of it as the "main assembly point" where all the constructor injection wiring happens in one place.

- **Constructor Injection**: The pattern where each class receives all its dependencies through its constructor
- **Dependency Container**: The single place where all these constructors are called with the right dependencies

The container itself uses constructor injection (it receives `AppConfig` in its constructor), and it ensures all other objects are created with constructor injection too.

## Current Architecture Problems

### 1. Mixed Dependency Creation Patterns
- Some classes create their own dependencies internally (e.g., `PropertyEnricher` creates `WikipediaExtractor`)
- Some classes accept partial dependencies but create others (e.g., `PropertyIndexer`)
- Configuration is loaded multiple times from different places
- No clear ownership of object lifecycle

### 2. Hidden Dependencies
- Classes create their own dependencies internally
- Optional parameters with fallback creation
- Configuration loaded multiple times
- No clear dependency graph

### 3. Testing Difficulties
- Cannot easily inject mock dependencies
- Hard to test components in isolation
- Integration tests required for simple unit testing scenarios

### 4. Configuration Confusion
- Both `Config` and `Settings` classes exist
- Configuration loaded from YAML in multiple places
- No single source of truth for configuration

## Proposed Constructor Injection Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: All dependencies passed through constructor
2. **No Hidden Creation**: Classes never create their own dependencies
3. **Single Configuration**: One configuration object, loaded once
4. **Dependency Container**: Central place for object creation and wiring
5. **Clean Interfaces**: Clear contracts between components

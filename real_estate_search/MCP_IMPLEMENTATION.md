# MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Implementation Principles
* NO MIGRATION PHASES: Do not create temporary compatibility periods
* NO PARTIAL UPDATES: Change everything or change nothing
* NO COMPATIBILITY LAYERS: Do not maintain old and new paths simultaneously
* NO BACKUPS OF OLD CODE: Do not comment out old code "just in case"
* NO CODE DUPLICATION: Do not duplicate functions to handle both patterns
* NO WRAPPER FUNCTIONS: Direct replacements only, no abstraction layers
* DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED or IMPROVED: Update actual methods directly
* Use snake_case consistently throughout
* Full Pydantic validation for all data models
* No optional imports - all dependencies are required
* Clean, modular, high-quality demo implementation
* Drop and recreate database approach (demo focus, not production complexity)

2. **Enrichment Failures**
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic
   - Fallback: Allow partial enrichment

### Operational Risks
1. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Load test thoroughly
   - Fallback: Optimize queries and caching

2. **Missing Features**
   - Mitigation: Complete feature inventory
